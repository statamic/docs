## Resolving the current site

When you're using the `Site::current()` method, sometimes the current page URL will lead to the wrong site being returned (like when using Livewire). In this case, you can use the resolveCurrentUrlUsing to check against a different URL:

```php
// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php

use Statamic\Facades\Site;

Site::resolveCurrentUrlUsing(fn () => Livewire::originalUrl());
```
