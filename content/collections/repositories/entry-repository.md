```

## Methods

| Methods | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `all()` | Get all Entries |
| `find($id)` | Get Entry by `id` |
| `findByUri($uri, $site)` | Get Entry by `uri`, optionally in a site |
| `query()` | Query Builder |
| `whereCollection($handle)` | Get all Entries in a `Collection` |
| `whereInCollection([$handles])` | Get all Entries in an array of `Collections` |
| `make()` | Makes a new entry instance |

## Querying

#### Examples {.popout}

#### Get a single entry by its id

```php
Entry::query()->where('id', 123)->first();

// Or with the shorthand method
Entry::find(123);
```

#### Get an entry by its URI

```php
Entry::query()->where('uri', 'blog/my-first-post')->first();

// Or with the shorthand method
Entry::findByUri('/blog/my-first-post');
```

:::tip
**What is the difference between `URI` and `URL`?** `URL` includes the site root (e.g. `/fr/` in a multisite), if there is one, while `URI` is site agnostic and will not. As you may have surmised, when you only have a single site â€” they are identical.

#### Get all entries in a collection

```php
Entry::query()
  ->where('collection', 'blog')
  ->get();
```

#### Get an entry from a collection by its slug

```php
Entry::query()
    ->where('collection', 'blog')
    ->where('slug', 'my-first-post')
    ->first();
```

#### Get an entry by its slug in a multi-site install

```php
Entry::query()
    ->where('collection', 'team')
    ->where('slug', 'director')
    ->where('site', 'albuquerque')
    ->get();
```

#### Get all Pre-Y2K news

```php
Entry::query()
    ->where('collection', 'news')
    ->where('date', '<', '2000') // [tl! ~~]
    ->get();
```

#### Get all of today's news

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;

Entry::query()
    ->where('collection', 'news')
    ->where('date', Carbon::parse('today'))
    ->get();
```

#### Get the last 12 months of news

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;

Entry::query()
    ->where('collection', 'news')
    ->where('date', '>=', Carbon::parse('now')->subYears(1))
    ->get();
```

#### Find all entries authored by Jack

```php
$author = User::findByEmail('jack@statamic.com');

Entry::query()
    ->where('collection', $handle)
    ->where('author', $author->id())
    ->get();
```

#### Get all entries using a specific Blueprint

```php
Entry::query()
    ->where('blueprint', 'editorial')
    ->get();
```

#### Get all published and scheduled entries

```php
Entry::query()
  ->whereIn('status', ['published', 'scheduled'])
  ->get();
```

## Creating

Start by making an instance of an entry with the `make` method.
You need at least a slug and the collection before you can save an entry.

```php
$entry = Entry::make()->collection('blog')->slug('my-entry');
```

You may call additional methods on the entry to customize it further.

```php
$entry
  ->date($carbon) // or string of Y-m-d or Y-m-d-Hi
  ->published(true) // or false for a draft
  ->locale('default') // the site handle. defaults to the default site.
  ->blueprint('article') // set entry blueprint
  ->data(['foo' => 'bar']) // an array of data (front-matter)
  ->origin($origin); // another entry instance
```

Finally, save it. It'll return a boolean for whether it succeeded.

```php
$entry->save(); // true or false
```
