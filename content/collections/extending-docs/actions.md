intro: Actions allow you perform tasks on one or more items. You can trigger actions by selecting multiple items in a listing, or using each item's contextual menu.

## Defining an action

You may create an action using the following command, which will generate a class in the `App\Actions` namespace.

``` shell
php please make:action
```

### Basics

The most basic action should have a `run` method.

``` php
use Statamic\Actions\Action;

class Delete extends Action
{
    public function run($items, $values)
    {
        $items->each->delete();

        return trans_choice('Item deleted.|:count items deleted.', $items);
    }
}
```

The `run` method is for executing the task. You will be provided with a collection of `$items`, and any submitted `$values` (more about those later).

You may customize the outcome of the action by providing a [response](#responses).

### Redirects

If you want to redirect after your action completes, override the `redirect` method and return a route or URL:

``` php
public function redirect($items, $values)
{
    return route('some.where.over.the', $rainbow);
}
```

### Downloads

To produce a download, override the `download` method and return a file path or download response:

``` php
public function download($items, $values)
{
    return storage_path('some/file.pdf');
}
```

## Registering an Action

Any action classes in the `App\Actions` namespace will be automatically registered.

If you would like to store them elsewhere, you can manually register an action in a service provider by calling the static `register` method on your action class.

``` php
public function boot()
{
    Your\Action::register();
}
```

## Filtering Actions

You may limit which items an action can be applied to using the `visibleTo` method. For example, if you want your action to only be used by entries, you can return a boolean like this:

``` php
use Statamic\Contracts\Entries\Entry;

public function visibleTo($item)
{
    return $item instanceof Entry;
}
```

:::best-practice
Don't include authorization in your `visibleTo` method. Instead, use the authorize method below.
:::

## Authorizing Actions

Before any actions are run, Statamic will make sure the user is allowed to run them. You can return a boolean like this:

``` php
public function authorize($user, $item)
{
    return $user->can('edit', $item);
}
```

By default, there is no authorization.

## Dangerous Actions

You can mark an action as dangerous, which will give it red text and more sinister looking confirmation dialog.

``` php
protected $dangerous = true;
```

## Context

Each action may have additional contextual data passed to it depending on which listing its being used within. For example, you may find
the collection handle when used inside an entry listing, or the asset container handle when used in an asset listing

``` php
$this->context; // ['collection' => 'blog']
```

You may find this useful when building confirmation dialog fields:

## Adding Fields

By default, an action will prompt you with an "Are you sure?" dialog.

You're free to add additional fields to the action by adding a `$fields` property with a fieldset-style definition. Each will be added to the confirmation dialog.

``` php
protected $fields = [
    'message' => [
        'type' => 'text',
        'validate' => 'required|min:40',
    ]
];
```

If you need more control over the fields, you can use the `fieldItems` method instead. Within this method, you can use `$this->context`. Then return the same array as described above.

``` php
protected function fieldItems()
{
    return [
        'message' => ['type' => 'text'],
    ];
}
```

The values entered into these fields when a user runs the action will be passed into the `run` method.


## Responses

Within an action's `run` method, you may return different things.

### Void
Returning nothing will result in a generic success toast notification saying "Action Completed".

```php
public function run($values)
{
    // do something, but don't return anything
}
```

### String
Returning a string will customize the toast notification text.

```php
public function run($values)
{
    // do something

    return __('The thing was done.');
}
```

### Array
You may return an array with a `message` key in it. The message will be shown in the toast notification. Any additional keys will be passed into the event handler, useful if you are implementing your own listing component.

```php
public function run($values)
{
    // do something

    return [
        'message' => 'This will be in the toast.',
        'foo' => 'bar',
    ];
}
```
```html
<data-list-bulk-actions ... @completed="completed" />
```
```js
completed(success, response) {
  this.$toast.success(response.message);
  this.doSomethingWithFoo(response.foo);
}
```

### Custom JavaScript Callback

You may return an array with a `callback` key in it. This should be an array with the name of the callback, and any arguments it should receive.

```php
public function run($values)
{
    // do something

    return [
        'callback' => ['myCallback', 'arg1', 'arg2'],
    ];
}
```

You can provide the callback from your JavaScript.

```js
Statamic.$callbacks.add('myCallback', function (foo, bar) {
  console.log(foo, bar); // "arg1", "arg2"
});
```

:::tip
A common reason for wanting to use JavaScript here is to copy a value to the user's clipboard. There's a native callback you can use so you don't need to write the JavaScript yourself:

```php
return [
    'callback' => ['copyToClipboard', 'text to copy']
];
```
:::

### Disabling the toast
You may wish to disable the toast notification, perhaps if you are planning to trigger your own notification as part of your JavaScript callback. You can disable it by passing a value of `false`.

```php
public function run($values)
{
    // do something

    return [
        'message' => false,
    ];
}
```
