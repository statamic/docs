title: Command Palette
---

The command palette provides handy access to many pages and actions in the Control Panel without having to leave your keyboard.

    <img src="/img/command-palette.png" alt="Command Palette">

</figure>

Out of the box, it provides things like:

- Content search
- Control panel navigation
- Recently visited pages
- Intelligent page-specific and contextually relevant actions
- Links to relevant documentation
- Access to user preferences, light/dark mode, etc.


## Extending the Command Palette

If you're [extending the CP nav](/extending/cp-navigation), the command palette will automagically populate itself with those nav items ðŸŽ‰

However, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to add more custom items to the command palette. You can do this in a variety of ways...

### PHP

If you wish to add basic links that will be available globally throughout the whole control panel, PHP is a great place to do this. Simply add the following to a service provider:

```php
use Statamic\Facades\CommandPalette;

CommandPalette::add(
    text: 'Staff Calendar'
    url: '/custom-laravel-route',
    icon: 'calendar',
);
```

:::warning
It is not recommended to add page-specific items in controllers, etc., because of Statamic's command palette caching strategy; If you wish to add more contextual items to your command palette, please use the [JavaScript API](#javascript) instead.
:::

#### Advanced Link Example

You can also pass an array to `text` if you want to use the same arrow conventions Statamic uses throughout the command palette (ie. `Search Â» Ancient Â» Hotbot`).

Or maybe you want to configure whether to `openNewTab`, or even disable `trackRecent` to prevent it from showing up in recent items, etc.

```php
use Statamic\Facades\CommandPalette;

CommandPalette::add(
    text: ['Search', 'Ancient', 'Hotbot'],
    url: 'https://hotbot.com',
    icon: 'sexy-robot',
    openNewTab: true,
    trackRecent: false,
);
```

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a great place to add page-specific links, or even contextually relevant actions that might require JS logic.

Parameter-wise, the JS API mostly mirrors the parameter set of the PHP API, with a few key differences and additions:

1. The `add()` method is available via the global `Statamic.$commandPalette` helper:

    ```js
    Statamic.$commandPalette.add({
        text: ['Search', 'Ancient', 'Hotbot'],
        url: 'https://hotbot.com',
        icon: 'sexy-robot',
        openNewTab: true,
    });
    ```

2. The JS API allows you to specify custom `action` and `when` functions, for controlling `when` the item is visible in realtime, or for running custom JS `action` logic on selection:

    ```js
    Statamic.$commandPalette.add({
        text: 'Celebrate',
        icon: 'star',
        when: () => entryIsPublished(),
        action: () => throwConfetti(),
    });
    ```

3. The JS API gives you a bit more control over where the item is displayed in the command palette.

    For example, though items are always fuzzy-searchable, they are normally rendered further down in the `Miscellaneous` section of the command palette. You can increase visibility by moving them to top section of the command palette by putting them into the `Actions` category:

    ```js
    Statamic.$commandPalette.add({
        // ...
        category: Statamic.$commandPalette.category.Actions,
    });
    ```

    On busier pages, you can also `prioritize` primary callout style actions to the very very top, since they normally default to alphabetical order within the section:

    ```js
    Statamic.$commandPalette.add({
        // ...
        prioritize: true,
    });
    ```

4. The `trackRecent` option for `url` based link items defaults to `false` on the JS side, because things tend to be more context-specific on the JS side. Of course, you can override this:

    ```js
    Statamic.$commandPalette.add({
        // ...
        trackRecent: true,
    });
    ```

### Template Component

Sometimes you'll find yourself in a situation where you want to use the JS API to wire up a simple link or button in your template to your command palette, and you don't want to have to extract out to a JS component to do so.

For these situations, you may use the `<ui-command-palette-item>` component, which is a Vue component that wraps the [JS API](#javascript):

```html
<ui-command-palette-item
    text="Hotbot"
    url="https://hotbot.com"
    open-new-tab
>
    <a href="https://hotbot.com" target="_blank">Hotbot</a>
</ui-command-palette-item>
```

If you want to dry up duplication, you may also use the `v-slot` to reuse things like `text`, `icon`, `url`, etc.

```html
<ui-command-palette-item
    text="{{ __('Hotbot') }}"
    url="https://hotbot.com"
    icon="visit-website"
    open-new-tab
    v-slot="{ text, url, icon }"
>
    <ui-button :text="text" :href="url" :icon="icon"></ui-button>
</ui-command-palette-item>
```
