intro: |
  Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of the application, or even modify behavior or output of core functionality. A single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each other.
---
## Overview {#overview}

Statamic will dispatch a number of events in various locations throughout the codebase.

In a nutshell, you'd create an event listener or subscriber, connect them together in a service provider, then handle the event.

``` php
protected $listen = [
    'SomeEvent' => [
        'SomeListener',
    ],
];
```
``` php
class SomeListener
{
    public function handle(SomeEvent $event)
    {
        //
    }
}
```

Consult the [Laravel event documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/events) for a more in-depth explanation on events.

If you're creating an addon, you can quickly [register event listeners or subscribers](/extending/addons#events).
