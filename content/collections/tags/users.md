## Overview

The Users tag works very much like the [Collection Tag](/tags/collection). It fetches, filters, sorts, groups, and manipulates lists of your users so you can whatever you want with them.

A simple example is to loop through all the users and list them by name:

```
<ul>
{{ users }}
    <li>{{ name }}</li>
{{ /users }}
</ul>
```

## Filtering

You can filter you users by group, role, field, or even custom filter class if you need extra control.

### Conditions

Want to avoid listing users who have the words "hipster" and "coffee" in their bio?

```
{{ users bio:doesnt_contain="hipster" bio:doesnt_contain="coffee" }}
```

There are a whole pile of conditions available to you, like `:is`, `:isnt`, `:contains`, `:starts_with`, and `:is_before`. Check out this page [dedicated to conditions](/conditions).

### Custom Query Scopes

Doing something custom or complicated? You can create [query scopes](/extending/query-scopes-and-filters) to narrow down those results with the `query_scope` or `filter` parameter:

```
{{ users query_scope="your_query_scope" }}
```

### Examples

#### Only super users

```
{{ user super:is="true" }}
  // these people are powerful
{{ /user }}
```

#### Exclude users with gmail email address

```
{{ users email:doesnt_end_with="@gmail.com" }}
  // cool stuff goes here
{{ /users }}
```
