## Overview

:::warning
Not to be confused with [the children variable when inside the Nav tag](/tags/nav#variables).
:::

The children tag allows you to fetch data and loop over the children of the current page/URL. Can be handy when building a sub-nav, for example.

You can get the parent by using the [Parent tag](/tags/parent).

## Example

```antlers
{{ children }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /children }}
```
