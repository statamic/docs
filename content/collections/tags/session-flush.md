## Example

::tabs

::tab antlers
```antlers
{{ session:flush }}
```
::tab blade
```blade
{{-- Using Statamic Antlers Components --}}
<s:session:flush />

{{-- Using PHP --}}
@php(session()->flush())
```
::

That's all there is to it. How you use it is up to you. You may want to tuck this away behind an `if` statement or a unique URL.

**Did you know?** In Australia the session flushes the other way. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
