## Overview

After an initial render, markup inside a cache tag will be pulled from a cached,statically cached copy until invalidated.


```
{{ cache for="5 minutes" }}
  {{ collection:stocks limit="5000" }}
    <!-- probably lots of stuff happening -->
  {{ /collection:stocks }}
{{ /cache }}
```

It really only makes sense to use the cache tag if you're not using another full-site type of caching, like static or full measure. There's nothing to be gained by caching a cache. That would be like buying four $5 bills with a $20. What have you gained other than a fatter wallet?
