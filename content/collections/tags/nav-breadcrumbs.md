intro: >
  Breadcrumbs are a common form of site navigation designed to give the user a view of where the current page is in the parent/child hierarchy. Much like the crumbs left by a certain little German boy â€” they lead from wherever you are, all the way back home.

## Overview

This tag looks at the current URL and look for any entries that match each segment. Let's say you visit `/italian/articles/dance`. The logic works like this:

1. Looks for an entry with a URL of /italian/articles/dance.
2. Pops the last segment off (`dance`) and look for an entry with a url of `/italian/articles`
3. Do the same for `/italian`
4. If `include_home` is set to `true`, look an entry with a url of `/`.

If any of the URLs don't match an entry in the current site, they will be skipped, so be sure to create translations for parent pages you if you're working on a multisite.

:::tip
Breadcrumbs don't follow structures, they follow the current URL hierarchy.

## Example

Here's an example of what breadcrumbs might look like, as well as a code example in use.

<figure>
    <div class="flex font-mono">
      <div class="mr-4">Home</div>
      <div class="mr-4">&rarr;</div>
      <div class="mr-4">Blog</div>
      <div class="mr-4">&rarr;</div>
      <div class="mr-4 text-pink-hot font-bold">How to Dress Like David Hasselhoff</div>
    </div>
    <figcaption>These crumbs are delicious.</figcaption>
</figure>

```
<ul class="breadcrumbs">
    {{ nav:breadcrumbs }}
    <li{{ if is_current }} class="current"{{ /if }}>
        <a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a>
    </li>
    {{ /nav:breadcrumbs }}
</ul>
```
