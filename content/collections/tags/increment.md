## Overview

Most loops already have an `index` variable that will display which iteration the loop is on. However, there are cases were you may need to start another counter, begin counting from a particular number, or increment by a step size other than `1`. For those reasons, this tag exists.

```
{{ items }}
  {{ increment }}
{{ /items }}
```

```html
0 1 2 3 4 5
```

:::tip
A counter will only be incremented if its parsed. You can wrap it inside an `if` condition if you want it to be conditionally incremented.
:::

## Multiple Counters

You can have multiple counters going at once in your view by giving each a unique name as the second tag argument.

```
{{ items }}
  {{ increment:again }}
{{ /items }}
```

## Customize the Counters

Customize the counts using the `from` and `by` parameters.

```
{{ items }}
  {{ increment from="0" by="200" }}
{{ /items }}
```

```html
0 200 400 600 800 100
```
