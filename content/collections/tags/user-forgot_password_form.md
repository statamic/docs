## Overview

Users will enter their email address in the form and, upon submitting, an email will be sent with a link to create a new password.

Unless you set a `redirect` parameter, the user will be redirected back to the **same page** after submitting, and the `success` variable will allow you to show a success message.

## Example

```
{{ user:forgot_password_form reset_url="/reset-password" }}

    {{ if errors }}
        <div class="bg-red-300 text-white p-2">
            {{ errors }}
                {{ value }}<br>
            {{ /errors }}
        </div>
    {{ /if }}

    {{ if success }}
        <div class="bg-green-300 text-white p-2">
            {{ success }}<br>
        </div>
    {{ /if }}

    <label>Email</label>
    <input type="text" name="email" value="{{ old:email }}" />

    <button type="submit">Send Reset Email</button>

{{ /user:forgot_password_form }}
```

The email will contain a link to the URL specified in the `reset_url` parameter, along with extra query parameters. On that URL you must have a [user:reset_password_form](/tags/user-reset_password_form) tag to finish the task and let the user set their new password.

:::tip
The user needs to be logged out for this tag to do anything. You may want to wrap the form in `{{ if logged_out }}{{ /if }}`.

## The email {#email}

Once the form is submitted, an email will be sent containing the URL for resetting the password.

This email is bundled with Statamic and will work for most people out of the box. However, if you'd like to customize it, you can.

The template is named `user-reset` and should contain a `{{ reset_url }}` variable, which is the generated reset URL.
