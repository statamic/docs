## Overview

Most commonly this take is used to avoid any kind of variable collisions or to confirm data to a particular naming mechanism. Scoping is most often done on the Tag level (e.g. the [Collection Tag](/tags/collection/#scope)), but gives you another level of control and flexibility.

## Example

```
---
title: Grimmace Shake
---

{{ scope:stuff }}
<h1>{{ stuff:title }}</h1>
{{ /scope:stuff }}
```

This will output:

```html
<h1>Grimmace Shake</h1>
```
