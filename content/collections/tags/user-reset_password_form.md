## Overview

After a user has put their email address into the [user:forgot_password_form](/tags/user-forgot_password_form), they'll arrive here to reset their password. This is the form used to create a _new_ password. That's really all there is to it.

## Example

```
{{ user:reset_password_form }}

    {{ if success }}

        <p class="alert alert-success">Password has been reset.</p>

    {{ elseif url_invalid }}

        <p class="alert alert-danger">This reset URL is invalid.</p>

    {{ else }}

        {{ if errors }}
            <div class="alert alert-danger">
                {{ errors }}
                    {{ value }}<br>
                {{ /errors }}
            </div>
        {{ /if }}

        <label>E-Mail</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" />

        <label>Password</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" />

        <label>Password Confirmation</label>
        <input type="password" name="password_confirmation" />

        <button>Submit</button>

    {{ /if }}

{{ /user:reset_password_form }}
```

## Arriving at this URL

This URL needs to have the appropriate `token` query parameter (e.g. `/some/url?token=the-generated-token-goes-here`)

Visiting the URL containing this form _directly_ will set a `url_invalid` variable. You can use this variable to check if they've actually arrived here through the password reset mail. This variable just checks whether there is a `token` query parameter available in the URL. This token will then be sent along with the email address and new password they fill out in an attempt to reset their password. If the token is incorrect, a validation error will be shown after submitting the form.

The reset password mail which contains the right `token` may be sent by using a `user:forgot_password_form` tag.
