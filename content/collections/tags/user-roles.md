## Overview

The User Roles tag fetches lists of the user roles on your site so you can do whatever you want with them.

A simple example is to loop through all the roles and list them by handle:

```
<ul>
{{ user_roles }}
    <li>{{ handle }}</li>
{{ /user_roles }}
</ul>
```

## Filtering

If you only want a specific role or roles, you can pass their handle(s) using the `handle` parameter.

```
{{ user_roles handle="group_1|group_2" }}
  // cool stuff goes here
{{ /user_roles }}
```
