## Overview
You can create a fully qualified URL to any resource, asset, or page on your site using a path relative string.

For example, if you had a link to `<a href="fanny-packs">`, it would be broken if you left that relative area of the site. By using the link tag you can ensure it's relative to your site root, and include the domain if needed.

```
{{ link to="fanny-packs" }}
{{ link to="fanny-packs" absolute="true" }}
```

```html
/fanny-packs
https://example.com/fanny-packs
```

## Link to Entries

You can also link to entries using their ID directly:

```
{{ link to="1715c9a8-0662-4ca7-b9ea-1ad642431fae" }}
```

``` output
/the-pages-slug
```

When using Multi-Site, the URL automatically links to the entry on the current site. If you want to link to a specific site instead, you can add the `in` parameter:

```
{{ link to="1715c9a8-0662-4ca7-b9ea-1ad642431fae" in="spanish" }}
```

``` output
/es/el-asdf-de-la-pagina
```
