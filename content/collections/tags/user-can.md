## Overview

User tags are designed for sites that have areas or features behind a login. The `{{ user:can }}` tag is used to check if the currently logged in user has a one or more specific permissions.

## Example

Let's say we want a link to edit the current entry in the control panel if the user has the `edit faq entries` permission.

```
{{ user:can do="edit faq entries" }}
    <a href="{{ edit_url }}">Edit this Page</a>
{{ /user:can }}
```

## Super Users

[Super users](/users#super-users) can always do everything, so no matter what you check for â€” whether it exists as an actual permission or not â€” it will always return `true`.

## Canâ€™t

We also support the negative use case using `{{ user:cant }}` tags.

```
{{ user:cant do="anything" }}
  <p>Aww, I'm sure that's not true! ðŸ˜Š</p>
{{ /user:cant }}
```
