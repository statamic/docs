## Overview
The `{{ user:profile }}` tag has access to all of a user's basic data. Passwords and hashes are _not_ available through this tag.

> This will default to the currently logged in user if none are specified.


## Shorthand

You can use `{{ user }}` and drop the `:profile` bit off if you prefer.

## Examples

To output the currently logged in user's details, you can do this:

```
{{ user }}
  The current user's name is {{ name }}.
{{ /user }}
```

Or perhaps you'd like to show user profile pages. Assuming your users have a `username` field, you could create a wildcard route like this:

```php
Route::statamic('users/{username}', 'users.show');
```

Then when visiting `/users/chuck`, for example, you could display Chuck's details like this:

```
{{ user:profile field="username" :value="segment_2" }}
  {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}
{{ /user:profile }}
```
Or to find a user by email:

```
{{ user:profile :email="email" }}
  {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}
{{ /user:profile }}
```
