## Example

::tabs

::tab antlers
```antlers
{{ if {form:success in="contact"} }}
    <p>Thanks for filling out the survey! Sorry it was so long.</p>
{{ /if }}
```

:::tip
`form:success` is a Tag, not a variable. Be sure to wrap it with single braces when inside a condition.
:::

::tab blade
```blade
{{-- Using Fluent Tags --}}
@if (Statamic::tag('form:success')->in('contact')->fetch())
  <p>Thanks for filling out the survey! Sorry it was so long.</p>
@endif

{{-- Using Antlers Blade Components --}}
<s:form:success
  in="contact"
>
  <p>Thanks for filling out the survey! Sorry it was so long.</p>
</s:form:success>
```
