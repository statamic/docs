title: Assets
intro: >
    Used to retrieve [Assets](/assets) directly from a container where you can then loop, filter, and sort them in expected but exciting ways.
description: Fetches Assets from a container
stage: 3
parameters:
  -
    name: id|container|handle
    type: string

      Every [asset container](/assets/#containers) has a unique handle. Pass it in and win! Default: `main`.
  -
    name: folder
    type: string
    description: |
      Filter the resulting assets by specific folder. Default: none.
  -
    name: recursive
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If you enable recursion, the tag will return all the assets in all the subdirectories that match your parameters. Default: `false`.
  -
    name: limit
    type: integer
    description: Limit the total results to a specific number.
  -
    name: offset
    type: integer

  -
    name: sort
    type: string
    description: >
      Sort entries by any available asset variable, or `random`. Pipe-separate multiple fields for sub-sorting and specify sort direction of each field using a colon. Example: `sort="size"` or `sort="size:asc|title:desc"` to sort by size _then_ by title.

## Overview

If you ever find yourself needing to loop over all the assets in a container or folder instead of selecting them manually with the [assets fieldtype](/fieldtypes/assets), this tag was designed to make you smile.

```
{{ assets container="photoshoots" }}
    <img src="{{ url }}" alt="{{ alt }}" />
{{ /assets }}
```

This tag returns an array of [Asset](/assets) objects. You'll have access to all the data and meta data on each file.
