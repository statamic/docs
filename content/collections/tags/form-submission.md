## Example

Here we'll output a small thank-you note once there's a successful submission, otherwise show the form itself.

::tabs

::tab antlers

The `{{ name }}` and `{{ rating }}` variables correspond to input fields of the same name.

```antlers
{{ form:set is="feedback" }}
    {{ if {form:success} }}

        {{ form:submission }}
            Thanks for your feedback, {{ name }}.
            We appreciate the {{ rating }} star rating you gave us.
        {{ /form:submission }}

    {{ else }}

        {{ form:create }} ... {{ /form:create }}

    {{ /if }}
{{ /form:set }}
```
::tab blade

The `{{ $submission['name'] }}` and `{{ $submission['rating'] }}` variables correspond to input fields of the same name.

```blade
<s:form:set
  is="feedback"
>
  @if (Statamic::tag('form:success')->in('feedback')->fetch())
    <s:form:submission
      as="submission"
    >
      Thanks for your feedback, {{ $submission['name'] }}.
      We appreciate the {{ $submission['rating'] }} star rating you gave us.
    </s:form:submission>
  @else
    <s:form:create>
      ...
    </s:form:create>
  @endif
</s:form:set>
```

:::tip
The `$success` variable is added by the `<s:form:set></s:form:set>` tag pair. It is a shortcut for the following:

```blade
@if (Statamic::tag('form:success')->in('feedback')->fetch())
  ...
@endif
```
