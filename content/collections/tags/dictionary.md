This tag allows you to loop through options from a [Dictionary](/fieldtypes/dictionary).

```
{{ dictionary handle="countries" }}
    {{ label }} {{ value }}
{{ /dictionary }}
```

You can also use the shorthand syntax for this:

```
{{ dictionary:countries }}
    {{ label }} {{ value }}
{{ /dictionary:countries }}
```

You can also output any additional data provided by the Dictionary, like `emoji` or `region` in the case of the Countries dictionary:

```
{{ dictionary:countries }}
    {{ emoji }} {{ name }} in {{ region }}
{{ /dictionary:countries }}
```

## Searching

```antlers
{{ dictionary:countries search="Aus" }}
    {{ label }} {{ value }}
{{ /dictionary:countries }}
```

```html
ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia AUS
ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ Austria AUT
```

## Conditions

```
{{ dictionary:countries region:is="Europe" }}
    {{ label }} {{ value }}
{{ /dictionary:countries }}
```

There are a bunch of conditions available to you, like `:is`, `:isnt`, `:contains`, `:starts_with`, and `:is_before`. There are many more than that. In fact, there's a whole page dedicated to [conditions - check them out](/conditions).

## Paginating

To enable pagination mode, add the `paginate` parameter with the number of options in each page.

```
{{ dictionary:countries paginate="10" as="countries" }}
    {{ countries }}
        {{ label }}<br>
    {{ /countries }}

    {{ paginate }}
        <a href="{{ prev_page }}">â¬… Previous</a>

        {{ current_page }} of {{ total_pages }} pages
        (There are {{ total_items }} posts)

        <a href="{{ next_page }}">Next âž¡</a>
    {{ /paginate }}
{{ /dictionary:countries }}
```

In pagination mode, your options will be scoped (in the example, we're scoping them into the `countries` tag pair). Use that tag pair to loop over the options in that page.

The `paginate` variable will become available to you. This is an array containing data about the paginated set.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `next_page` |	The URL to the next paginated page.
| `prev_page` |	The URL to the previous paginated page.
| `total_items` |	The total number of options.
| `total_pages` |	The number of paginated pages.
| `current_page` |	The current paginated page. (ie. the x in the ?page=x param)
| `auto_links` |	Outputs an HTML list of paginated links.
| `links` |	Contains data for you to construct a custom list of links.
| `links:all` |	An array of all the pages. You can loop over this and output {{ url }} and {{ page }}.
| `links:segments` |	An array of data for you to create a segmented list of links.

## Query Scopes

Doing something custom or complicated? You can create [query scopes](/extending/query-scopes-and-filters) to narrow down those results with the `query_scope` or `filter` parameter:

```
{{ dictionary:countries query_scope="your_query_scope" }}
```

You should reference the query scope by its handle, which is usually the name of the class in snake case. For example: `YourQueryScope` would be `your_query_scope`.

## Files

One of the powerful things you can do with the Files dictionary is pull in options from a JSON, YAML or CSV file.

```
{{ dictionary:file filename="products.json" label="Name" value="Code" paginate="5" }}
```
