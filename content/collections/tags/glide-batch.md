## Overview

Wraps content containing `<img>` tags and each will be manipulated with your desired Glide parameters.

This tag is useful when uniformly resizing all images inside a chunk of HTML or the contents of Markdown or other fields. If you wrap the tag around Antlers variables, be sure to use **page scope:** `{{ page:content }}` instead of `{{ content }}`.

## Example

``` markdown
I went exploring today and here are some photos I took and I was too lazy to use an Asset fieldtype so here they all are plop ok

![Bears](/images/bears.jpg)
![Beets](/images/beets.jpg)
![Battlestar](/images/galactica.jpg)
```

::tabs

::tab antlers
```antlers
{{ glide:batch width="600" height="400" fit="crop" }}
  {{ page:content }}
{{ /glide:batch }}
```
::tab blade
```blade
<s:glide width="600" height="400" fit="crop">
  {!! $page->content !!}
</s:glide>
```

```html
<p>I went exploring today and here are some photos I took and I was too lazy to use an Asset fieldtype so here they all are plop ok</p>

<img src="/img/assets/bears.jpg?w=600&h=400&fit=crop" title="Bears" />
