## Overview

What you do with this tag is up to you. It's that odd, multi-tool you don't have a use for..._until you need it desperately_. If you need to do stuff with listing files and their meta data, this might be the thing you're looking for.

Don't forget about [assets](/assets) though, they're a much more robust and controlled aspect of Statamic.

## Example

Here's a few examples of what you can do with the `get_files` tag.

### List non-asset images in the site's design resources

```
{{ get_files in="public/img/brand" }}
  <img src="{{ file }}" class="w-1/3">
{{ /get_files }}
```

### List the zip files in a web-inaccessible directory

```
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File</th>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>Last Modified</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  {{ get_files in="secure/downloads" }}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ basename }}</td>
      <td>{{ size }}</td>
      <td>{{ last_modified }}</td>
    </tr>
  {{ /get_files }}
  </tbody>
</table>
```
