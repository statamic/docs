Gets a value from a relationship based on its ID. This is like a nicer-to-read single tag version of the [Get_Content Tag](/tags/get_content).

```yaml
featured_post: 4e82a520-275f-11e6-bdf4-0800200c9a66
```

```
{{ featured_post | get:title }}
```

```html
Featured Post Title
```

The above is equivalent to doing this:

```
{{ get_content :from="featured_post" }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /get_content }}
```
