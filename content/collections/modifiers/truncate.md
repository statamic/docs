Truncates the string to a given length (parameter 1). You can append a string with parameter 2, and if truncating occurs the string is further truncated so that it may be appended without exceeding the desired length.

This differs from [safe_truncate][safe_truncate] in that it _may_ truncate in the middle of a word.
