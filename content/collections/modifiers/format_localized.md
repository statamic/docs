:::warning
Since Carbon 2.55.0 `formatLocalized` has been deprecated. Please use the [`iso_format`](/modifiers/iso_format) modifier instead.

Given a date string, or anything that sort of looks like a date string, `format` will convert it to a [Carbon][carbon] instance and allow you to format it with PHP's [strftime format][strftime] variables. It will use the current locale defined in your system settings.

For this to work you will need to have the necessary locales installed in your hosting environment.

```yaml
event_date: April 15 2016
```

```
{{ event_date format_localized="%A %d %B %Y" }}
```

Assuming your locale is `fr_FR`:

```html
Vendredi 15 avril 2016
```

[strftime]: http://php.net/strftime
