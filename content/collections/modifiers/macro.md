Macro is a very special modifier. It performs no modifications of its own, but rather lets you create reusable groups of modifiers and give them a name. Those groups are each called a "macro" and are stored in your `resources/macros.yaml` file. Keep in mind that the order of modifiers within a macro matter, the same way as regular modifiers.


```.language-yaml
# /resources/macros.yaml
headline:
  title: true
  widont: true
  remove_right: .

# Page content
title: Actually i don't know what we're talking about.
```

```
{{ title | macro:headline }}
```

```.language-output
I Don't Know What We're Talking&nbsp;About
```

When passing multiple parameters to a modifier, you'll need to pop down into a simple list:

```.language-yaml
# /resources/macros.yaml
excerpt:
  safe_truncate:
    - 175
    - ...
```

This is equivalent to:

```
{{ content | safe_truncate:175:... }}
```
