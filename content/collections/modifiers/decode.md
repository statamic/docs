title: Decode
---
Convert all HTML entities to their applicable characters via PHP's [html_entity_decode()][decode] function. Will convert both double and single quotes. This is the opposite of the [entities][entities] modifier.

```yaml
string: "I'll &quot;eat&quot; the &lt;b&gt;bacon&lt;/b&gt; now";
```

```
{{ string | decode }}
```

```html
I'll "eat" the <b>bacon</b> now
```
