Converts the string into an URL slug. This includes replacing non-ASCII characters with their closest ASCII equivalents, removing remaining non-ASCII
and non-alphanumeric characters, and replacing whitespace with dashes. And then everything is lowercased.


```.language-yaml
string: Please, have some lemoñade.
```

```
{{ string | slugify }}

```.language-output
