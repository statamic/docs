Check if a value contains another value. Supports both strings and arrays.

Returns `true` if a match is found, otherwise `false`.

The first parameter is the "needle" to find in the "haystack". It will read from the context if there is a matching
variable, otherwise it will use the parameter as the value.

## Strings

Case-insensitive by default but can be made sensitive by setting the second parameter to `true`.

```.language-yaml
summary: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."
adjective: best
noun: carrot
```

```
{{ if summary | contains:BEST }}
{{ if summary | contains:BEST:true }}
{{ if summary | contains:adjective }}
{{ if summary | contains:noun }}
```

```.language-output
true   (the substring "BEST" was in the string, and it didn't care about the case.)
false  (the substring "BEST" was in the string, however it didn't match the case.)
true   (there's a field named "adjective", and it got the value which was "best")
false  (there's a field named "noun", and it got the value which was "carrot")
```

## Arrays
You can set strict type checking by setting the second parameter to `true`.
``` .language-yaml
foods:
  - bacon
  - bread
  - tomato
delicious: bacon
gross: broccoli

numbers: [1, 2]
number: '1'
```

```
{{ if foods | contains:bacon }}
{{ if foods | contains:delicious }}
{{ if foods | contains:gross }}
{{ if (foods | contains:"vegan bacon strips") }}

{{ if numbers | contains:number }}
{{ if numbers | contains:number:true }}
```

``` .language-output
true   (there's no field named "bacon", so it searched for literally "bacon")
true   (there's a field named "delicious", and it got the value which was "bacon")
false  (there's a field named "gross", and it got the value which was "broccoli")
true   (there's no field named "vegan bacon strips", so it searched for literally "vegan bacon strips")

true   (the value of "number" is the string "1", which is fine in non-strict mode)
false  (with strict mode enabled, the string "1" won't match the integer)
```
