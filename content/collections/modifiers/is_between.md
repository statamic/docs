title: 'Is Between'

Returns `true` if a date variable is between two other dates. Those dates can be the name of other variables or literal date strings.

```yaml
date: November 15 2015
start_date: July 4 2015
end_date: December 1 2015
```

::tabs

::tab antlers
```antlers
{{ if date | is_between($start_date, $end_date) }}
```
::tab blade
```blade
@if (Statamic::modify($date)->isBetween([$start_date, $end_date])->fetch()) @endif
```
::

```html
true
```

:::warning
By default, when using a modifier on a date variable, it will be operating on the UTC date rather than the localized date.

Please refer to our [Timezones](/tips/timezones) guide for more information.
