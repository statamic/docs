A fresh Statamic install starts in Solo edition mode. You can enable Pro in your `.env` file at any time by running:

``` shell
php please pro:enable
```

You can also set `pro` to `true` in `config/statamic/editions.php` for all environments (which you may need to do for older installations of Statamic where the above command doesn't exist).

Once you've opted in, many additional features become be available.

## Trying Pro Mode {#trial-mode}

You can use Statamic Pro locally without a license key for as long as you'd like. This is called **Trial Mode**.

While in trial mode you are also able to try out any commercial [addons](https://statamic.com/addons).

## When It's Time to Launch

Once itâ€™s time to launch your site on a public domain, there are a few things you need to do:

- [Create a Site](#sites) on statamic.com and enter the appropriate domain(s).
- Purchase a license of [Statamic Pro](https://statamic.com/pricing) (and any paid addons) and attach them to your Site.
- Add your Site's license key to your environment file in production.

``` env
STATAMIC_LICENSE_KEY=your-site-license-key
```
