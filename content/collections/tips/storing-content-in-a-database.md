## Overview

Out of the box, Statamic stores your content in "flat files". However, there are a number of reasons you might find yourself reaching for a traditional database. Whether it fits better into your existing workflows or to enhance your site's performance, you'll be glad to know it's easy to switch.

## Moving content to the database
1. First things first, ensure your database is configured correctly. By default, Statamic sites are configured to use a SQLite database. However, [you're free to change this](https://laravel.com/docs/master/database#configuration) in your `.env`:
    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    # DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    # DB_PORT=3306
    # DB_DATABASE=laravel
    # DB_USERNAME=root
    # DB_PASSWORD=
    ```
2. Run `php please install:eloquent-driver`. It'll install the [Eloquent Driver](https://github.com/statamic/eloquent-driver) addon, publish it's configuration file and prompt you to select the repositories you wish to move to the database.

    You might find it useful to keep "configuration" repositories as flat files, whilst storing the actual content in the database. For example: moving `entries` to the database but leaving `collections` flat-file.

3. And that's you done! Wasn't that easy?

## Change your mind?
If you change your mind about moving content to the database, you can always move it back. Just use one of the following commands to export your content back into flat-files:

- Assets: `php please eloquent:export-assets`
- Blueprints and Fieldsets: `php please eloquent:export-blueprints`
- Collections: `php please eloquent:export-collections`
- Entries: `php please eloquent:export-entries`
- Forms: `php please eloquent:export-forms`
- Globals: `php please eloquent:export-globals`
- Navs: `php please eloquent:export-navs`
- Revisions: `php please eloquent:export-revisions`
- Taxonomies: `php please eloquent:export-taxonomies`
