## Understanding zero downtime deployment file structure

Zero downtime services like [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io/) and [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) use a multiple-release directory structure and symlinks to handle deployments. For example:

### The Envoyer file structure

``` files theme:serendipity-light
.env
storage
current -> symlinked to latest release
releases
  20220215112950
    .env -> symlinked to top level shared .env
    storage -> symlinked to top level shared storage
    app
    routes
    etc
  20220322153109
  20220323180225
  20220322153109
```

Each deployment creates a timestamped release folder, with a fresh clone of the app. The `.env` file and the `storage` folder are stored at the top level, and shared between releases using symlinks.

After a successful deployment, the `current` folder is then symlinked to the latest release. This symlink swap is the secret sauce for zero downtime.

## Cache storage

Statamic's content management heavily relies on caching, and sometimes it's necessary for the [Stache](/stache) to store absolute file paths in your app's cache. This can lead to deployment errors when while users are hitting your frontend, since each release [exists in a separate timestamped folder](#understanding-zero-downtime-deployment-file-structure).

The solution is simple. Just as you should never share a cache between different websites, you should never share a cache between your deployed releases.

### How to avoid sharing file cache

To avoid sharing file based cache between your deployment releases, create a cache folder at the top level in your app, bypassing the default `storage` folder, as it _is_ shared between releases. Configure your app to use a custom cache store location by changing `stores.file.path` in `config/cache.php`:

```php
'stores' => [
    'file' => [
        'driver' => 'file',
        'path' => storage_path('framework/cache/data'), // [tl! --]
        'path' => base_path('cache'), // [tl! ++]
    ],
],
```

### How to avoid sharing Redis cache

To avoid sharing a Redis cache between your deployment releases, we recommend setting a cache prefix unique to each release on your filesystem. This can be configured by adding a `redis.cache.options.prefix` in `config/database.php`:

```php
'redis' => [
    'cache' => [
        'url' => env('REDIS_URL'),
        'host' => env('REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
        'password' => env('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
        'port' => env('REDIS_PORT', '6379'),
        'database' => env('REDIS_CACHE_DB', '1'),
        'options' => [ // [tl! ++]
            'prefix' => basename(base_path()).'_', // [tl! ++]
        ], // [tl! ++]
    ],
],
```

## Git automation

If you plan to use Statamic's [Git Automation](/git-automation) features with zero downtime services like [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io/) and [Deployer](https://deployer.org/), you may need to tweak your deployment settings to enable git commit and push from each release folder.

### Setting up your git remote in Envoyer releases

By default, Envoyer clones each release without a git object, which Statamic needs for committing and pushing content back to your repository.

To set up a git object, add a deployment hook after the `Clone New Release` step to ensure a git object is created:

```bash
cd {{ release }}

git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:your/remote-repository.git
git fetch
git branch --track master origin/master
git reset HEAD
```

Be sure to modify the above remote to point to your remote repository, along with the branch you wish to track.

### Preventing circular deployments with Envoyer

If you plan to enabling automatic deployment when commits are pushed to your repository, you may wish to selectively disable deployments when Statamic pushes commits back to your repository.

To do this, you will first need to append `[BOT]` to Statamic's commit messages [as documented here](/git-automation#customizing-commits). Once this is done, you can add a deployment hook to cancel the deployment when `[BOT]` is detected in your commit message:

```php
if [[ "{{ message }}" =~ "[BOT]" ]]; then
    echo 'AUTO-COMMITTED ON PRODUCTION. NOTHING TO DEPLOY.'
    exit 1
fi
```

### Ensuring proper deployment hook order

When adding these deployment hooks, be mindful of the order in which these things happen. Here is where we recommend placing these hooks in your deployment flow:

### Committing form submissions

If you plan on committing form submissions, you will need to store them outside of the shared `storage` folder. You can customize your form submissions path in `config/statamic/forms.php`:

```php
'submissions' => storage_path('forms'), // [tl! --]
'submissions' => base_path('forms'), // [tl! ++]
```

After doing this, you will also need to update the tracked path for your submissions in `config/statamic/git.php`:

```php
'paths' => [
    base_path('content'),
    base_path('users'),
    resource_path('blueprints'),
    resource_path('fieldsets'),
    resource_path('forms'),
    resource_path('users'),
    storage_path('forms'), // [tl! --]
    base_path('forms'), // [tl! ++]
],
```
