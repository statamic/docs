By default, filesystem disk permissions are private for security.

If you want your assets to be publicly accessible, you need to set your disk's `visibility` to `public` in `config/filesystems.php`.

``` php
's3' => [
    'driver' => 's3',
    'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
    'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
    'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
    'url' => env('AWS_URL'),
    'visibility' => 'public', // ðŸ‘ˆ you're missing this
],
```

Conversely, if you **want** your files to be private, then you can either remove that line, or set it to `private`.

> This setting only applies to newly uploaded files. You'll need to log into AWS or Spaces and bulk change the permissions on existing files.
