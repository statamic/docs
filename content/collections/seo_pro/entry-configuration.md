SEO Pro allows you to configure a few different options on a per-entry basis. You can find entry specific configuration on an entry's individual page within the Link Manager:

## Preventing the entry from being suggested

Sometimes you may wish to prevent certain pages from being suggested to other entries. For example, you may not want a "frequently asked questions" page to appear in suggestions since it may contain a lot of various overlapping keywords.

Within the "Entry Settings" panel, toggle the "Can Be Suggested" option off and click "Save":

![Excluding an entry from suggestions](/img/seo-pro/entry-link-settings.png)

The entry will now longer be suggested to other entries.

## Resetting entry suggestions

To reset an entry's specific linking behavior configuration to its defaults, select "Reset Entry Suggestions" from the action drown-down menu in the top-right corner of the entry's link manager page:

![Resetting entry suggestions](/img/seo-pro/resetting-entry-configuration.png)

Performing this action will reset the following for the specific entry:

* **Ignored Entries**: Any other entry's specifically ignored for the entry
* **Ignored Phrases**: Any phrases or keywords that are ignored for the entry
