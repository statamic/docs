SEO Pro's content linking features provide additional user permissions and interact with existing permissions.

The following existing permissions will be considered when displaying links within the Link Manager, or when suggesting links or content:

* Only collections a user has access to will be available.
* Only sites a user has access to will be available.
* Editing Permissions: If a user cannot edit an entry, they will not be able to insert links or edit entries from the Link Manager.

In addition to interacting with existing permissions, the following additional permissions are available:

* **Manage Links**: Determines if the user will have access to any content linking features within the Control Panel. When revoked, the user will not be able to view the Link Manager.
  * **Edit Collection Linking Behavior**: Determines if the user can update collection linking behavior settings.
  * **Edit Site Linking Behavior**: Determines if the user can update site linking behavior settings.
  * **Edit Global Automatic Links**: Determines if the user can add/create/delete Global Automatic Links.
