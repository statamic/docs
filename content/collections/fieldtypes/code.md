intro: What are you doing writing code in a browser?! Just kidding, it's fine. We made it easy, flexible, and pretty too. We use this fieldtype a lot.

## Overview

If your content involves code snippets, this is the fieldtype for you. It's a [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) field with 25 of the most common languages ready for highlighting, handles tabs and spaces, has a dark mode, and best of all — for you super nerds out there — a vim key binding.

## Data Structure

The code fieldtype stores a string. Do whatever you'd like with it.

``` yaml
code: |
  <?php

  public function engage()
  {
    return "Make it so.";
  }
```

## Templating

You can output that string just as it is. If it is indeed code (and why wouldn't it be?), you'll probably want to to wrap it in pre and code tags to display it prettier. If you want code highlighting on your front-end, we recommend hooking up [prism.js](https://prismjs.com).

```
<pre><code>{{ your_code_field }}</code></pre>
```

You're also able to use it as an array if you want to output the mode.

```
{{ your_code_field }}
<pre class="language-{{ mode }}"><code>{{ code }}</code></pre>
{{ /your_code_field }}
```

### Variables

Inside an code fieldtype's tag pair you'll have access to the following variables.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `code` | The contents of the field. |
| `mode` | The selected language mode. |
