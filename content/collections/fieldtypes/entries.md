## Data Structure

This fieldtype will store an array of ids to the selected entries. They will be augmented in your Antlers templates to give you access to each entry's data.

``` yaml
related_entries:
  - 12f9be1f-a12e-4680-b769-639d2d1f1d14
  - ea48926d-bf67-4d45-9420-9627a31c37fb
  ```

## Templating

Loop through the entries and do anything you want with the data.

```
<ul>
  {{ related_entries }}
    <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a></li>
  {{ /related_entries }}
</ul>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="/look-at-this">Look at This!</a></li>
  <li><a href="/look-at-that">Wait, Look at That!</a></li>
</ul>
```
