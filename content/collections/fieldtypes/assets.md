## Overview

The assets fieldtype is used to manage and relate files with your entries. From the fieldtype you can manage custom fields on the assets themselves (learn more about that in the [assets guide](/assets)), preview full size images or rich media files, and even set focal points for cropping.

Files are rearrangeable via drag-and-drop.

## UI Modes

The list mode is shown above, while the grid mode is below. There are no functional differences, only visual ones. List mode is more compact â€“ useful if you're not primarily managing images.

  <img src="/img/fieldtypes/screenshots/assets-grid.png" width="543" alt="Assets Grid mode">
  <figcaption>Grid mode reveals a fanny pack in all of its glory.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Data Structure

Data is stored as an array of image paths _relative to the asset container_. Each asset's full URL is generated dynamically on the frontend based on the image path and its container. This allows containers to be a bit more portable by avoiding fully hardcoded file paths.

If `max_files` is set to `1`, a string will be saved instead of an array.

``` yaml
# Default YAML
gallery_images:
  - fresh-prince.jpg
  - dj-jazzy-jeff.jpg
  - uncle-phil.jpg

# With max_items: 1
hero_image: surf-boards.jpg
```

## Templating

The Asset fieldtype uses [augmentation](/augmentation) to automatically relate the files with their Asset records, pull in custom and meta data, and resolve all image paths based on the container.

By using a tag pair syntax, you'll be able to output variables for each asset:

```
{{ gallery_images }}
    <img src="{{ url }}" alt="{{ alt }}" />
{{ /gallery_images }}

{{ hero_image }}
    <img src="{{ url }}" alt="{{ alt }}" />
{{ /hero_image }}
```

```html
<img src="/assets/fresh-prince.jpg" alt="Will Smith as the Fresh Prince" />
<img src="/assets/dj-jazzy-jeff.jpg" alt="Jeffrey Allen Townes as DJ Jazzy Jeff" />
<img src="/assets/uncle-phil.jpg" alt="James Avery as Uncle Phil" />

<img src="/assets/surf-boards.jpg" alt="3 colorful surf boards" />
```

The same tag pair syntax can be used regardless of your `max_files` setting.

If you have `max_files: 1`, you can also use a single tag syntax to directly use a variable inside the asset. Without a second tag part, the URL will be used.

```
{{ hero_image }}
{{ hero_image:url }}
{{ hero_image:alt }}
```

```html
/assets/surf-boards.jpg
/assets/surf-boards.jpg
3 colorful surf boards
```

### Asset Field Data

All custom data set on the assets will also be available inside the asset tag loop.

```
{{ gallery_images }}
  <figure>
    <img src="{{ url }}" alt="{{ alt }}">
    <figcaption>{{ caption }}</figcaption>
  </figure>
{{ /gallery_images }}
