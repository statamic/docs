## Overview

Markdown has been around since 2004. One fateful day in December, [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) published his spec and first version of the Markdown parser. Since that day (it was a Friday), Markdown has grown wildly in popularity, and today has become the de facto standard format for writing portable content.

Back in 2004 there was just one flavor: John's. Today's landscape has many variations, parsers, extensions, and standards groups. The most widely accepted feature set is [Github-Flavored Markdown][gfm], or GFM for short.

Statamic uses the [League\CommonMark][commonmark] library to support GFM, to enable tables, special attributes like classes and ids on block-level elements, and fenced code blocks.

## Data Structure

The data will be saved exactly as written â€“ a Markdown string.

``` markdown
## Overview

This is the Markdown fieldtype. It's for writing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that magically transforms into HTML.
```

## Templating

The Markdown content will be automatically transformed into HTML through [augmentation](/augmentation). You need only use the variable and the rest is done for you.

```
{{ content }}
```

```html
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is the Markdown fieldtype. It's for writing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that magically transforms into HTML.</p>
```

## Dark Mode

The Markdown fieldtype also has a dark mode when in fullscreen for those of you who like that sort of thing.
