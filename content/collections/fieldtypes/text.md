title: Text
description: A simple text field that has the ability to morph into Dragons! Just kidding. Just standard HTML5 input types.
overview: >
  This is as basic as a fieldtype gets. In fact, it is _the_ default fieldtype. A plain, text input used to store string data. It also supports the ability to use any native HTML input types, though your mileage may vary with some of them.
options:
  -
    name: mode
    type: string
    description: >
      You can pass the name of an [HTML5 input mode](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp) to switch its behavior. For example, `number` or `email`.

    name: autoslug
    type: string

      Generate a slug in this text field based on the value of a given field. For example, how an entry's `slug` field gets generated from the `title` field.
