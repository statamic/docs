## Overview

The most common use for the Users fieldtype is to set the "author" for entries, but it's not the only use. You could...

- List people who contributed to a project
- Link to related authors
- Manage an "Employee of the Weekend" section. Everyone wants to be the King or Queen of Inventory Saturday, right?
- Display team bios
- Pull in customer's testimonials through their user account.

## Data Structure

The Users fieldtype is a [relationship fieldtype](/extending/relationship-fieldtypes) â€“ which mean the data will store a reference to the users IDs to main a dynamic link.

```yaml
author: abc-123-cba-321
```

## Templating

All relationship fields use [augmentation](/augmentation) to fetch the actual data objects, allowing you to interact with the related data automatically and dynamically.

```
<div class="bg-white p-4 shadow flex items-center">

  <img class="w-10 h-10 rounded-full" src="{{ avatar }}" alt="Avatar of {{ name }}">
    <div class="text-sm ml-4">
      <p class="text-gray-900 leading-none">{{ name }}</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600">{{ email }}</p>
    </div>
{{ /author }}
</div>
```
