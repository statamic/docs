## Overview

The radio fieldtype is a multiple choice input where you only get one choice. It saves the chosen option from a preset list.

## Configuring

Use the `options` setting to define a list of values and labels.

``` yaml
favorite:
  type: radio
  instructions: Choose your favorite food.
  options:
    donuts: Donuts
    icecream: Ice Cream
    brownies: Brownies
```

You may omit the labels and just specify keys. If you use this syntax, the value and label will be identical.

``` yaml
  options:
    - Donuts
    - Ice Cream
    - Brownies
```

## Data Structure

The chosen option is stored as a string. If you only specified values for the `options` array, then the label will be saved.

``` yaml
favorite: brownies
```



## Templating

It's a string, so you can just use that value.

::tabs

::tab antlers
```antlers
<p>I love {{ favorite }}. A lot.</p>
```

::tab blade
```blade
<p>I love {{ $favorite }}. A lot.</p>
```
::

```html
<p>I love donuts. A lot.</p>
```
