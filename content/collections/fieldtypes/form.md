## Overview

The Form fieldtype is gives your users a way to pick a form to include along with the current entry. How that form is implemented or shows up on the page is up to you.

## Data Storage

The Form fieldtype stores the `handle` of a single form as a string, or an array of handles if `max_items` is greater than 1.

## Templating

The Form fieldtype provides a few useful variables:

* `handle`
* `title`
* `fields`
* `api_url`
* `honeypot`

You can use the [`{{ form:create }}`](/tags/form-create) tag to render a `<form>` on your page.
