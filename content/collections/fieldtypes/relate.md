## Relationship Types {#types}

You can relate any of the base [Content Types](/content-types), each of which with its own specific fieldtype. They all extend this core Relate fieldtype.

- [Taxonomy Terms](/fieldtypes/terms) - for Taxonomy Terms
- [Collection](/fieldtypes/entries) - for Entries
- [Pages](/fieldtypes/pages) - for Pages
- [Users](/fieldtypes/users) - for Users
- [Assets](/fieldtypes/assets) - for Assets (it doesn't extend this Relate fieldtype)

## Display Modes {#modes}

The Relate field can be displayed in two different modes. Both are functionally the same, just with a different UI.

Tags mode (the first field in the screenshot) is a more traditional tagging syntax. It will refine the selections as you type.

Panes mode (the second field) shows the available values and selections in separate fields.
