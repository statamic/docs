## Overview

This is as simple as you get. Set a default value and it it'll be stored when creating new entries. This is useful if you want to set specific data but don't want it editable in the Control Panel.

``` yaml
handle: snappy_comeback
field:
  type: hidden
  default: Eat my shorts
```

That's pretty much it. Nothing else to see here.
