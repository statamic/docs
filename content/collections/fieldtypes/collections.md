## Usage

This fieldtype is used to view and select from a list of Collections.

```yaml
fields:
  my_collections_field:
    type: collections
```

## Data Structure

The Collections fieldtype is a [Relate fieldtype](/fieldtypes/relate), and will save the collections as their handles (the folder name).

```yaml
listings:
  - blog
  - things
```

## Templating

You're more than likely using this field as a way to dynamically display a collection.

Since the collection tag accepts a pipe-delimited list of collection names, you can join them together likeÂ this:

```
<ul>
  {{ collection from="{listings|things}" }}
    <li>{{ title }}</li>
  {{ /collection }}
</ul>
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>A blog entry</li>
  <li>A thing entry</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>
```
