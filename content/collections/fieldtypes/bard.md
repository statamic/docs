  -
    name: sets

## Overview

Bard is our recommended fieldtype for creating long form content from the control panel. It's highly configurable, intuitive, user-friendly, and writes impeccable HTML (thanks to [ProseMirror][prosemirror]).

Bard also has the ability to manage "sets" of fields inline with your text. These sets can contain any number of other fields of any [fieldtype](/fieldtypes), and can be collapsed and neatly rearranged in your content.

## Working With Sets {#sets}

You can use any fieldtypes inside your Bard sets. Make sure to compare the experience with the other meta-fields: [Grid](/fieldtypes/grid) and [Replicator](/fieldtypes/replicator). You can even use Grids and Replicators inside your Bard sets. Just remember that because you can doesn't mean you should. Your UI experience can vary greatly.


## Data Structure

Bard stores your data as a [ProseMirror document](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Document_Structure). You should never need to interact with this data directly, thanks to [augmentation](/augmentation).

## Templating

### Without Sets

If you are using Bard just as a rich text editor and have no need for sets you would use a single tag to render the content.

```
{{ bard_field }}
```

### With Sets

When working with sets, you should use the tag pair syntax and `if/else` conditions on the `type` variable to style each set accordingly. The non-set content uses type `text`.

```
{{ bard_field }}

  {{ if type == "text" }}
    <div class="text">
      {{ text }}
    </div>

  {{ elseif type == "poll" }}
    <figure class="poll">
      <figcaption>{{ question }}</figcaption>
      <ul>
        {{ options }}
          <li>{{ text }}</li>
        {{ /options }}
      </ul>
    </figure>

  {{ elseif type == "hero_image" }}
    <div class="heroimage">
      <img src="{{ hero_image }}" alt="{{ caption }}" />
    </div>
  {{ /if }}

{{ /bard_field }}
```

An alternative approach (for those who like DRY or small templates) is to create multiple "set" partials and pass the data to them dynamically, moving the markup into corresponding partials bearing the set's name.

```
{{ bard_field }}
  {{ partial src="sets/{type}" }}
{{ /bard_field }}
```

``` files theme:serendipity-light
resources/views/partials/sets/
  gallery.antlers.html
  hero_image.antlers.html
  poll.antlers.html
  text.antlers.html
  video.antlers.html
```

## Extending Bard

Bard uses [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) (which in turn is built on top of [ProseMirror][prosemirror]) as the foundation for our quintessential block-based editor.

## Custom set icons

You can change the icons available in the set picker by setting an icons directory in a service provider. For example in the `boot()` method of your `AppServiceProvider.php`.

```php
\Statamic\Fieldtypes\Sets::setIconsDirectory(folder: 'light');
```

Or choose a different base directory altogether:

```php
\Statamic\Fieldtypes\Sets::setIconsDirectory(directory: resource_path('custom-icons'));
```
