title: 'Upgrade from 5 to 6'
intro: 'A guide for upgrading from 5 to 6. For most sites (those running Laravel > 10), the process will take less than 5 minutes.'
template: page

## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. While there are many items on this page, a majority of them only apply to addons or custom code. We've noted who each item would apply to so you can more easily scan through the changes.

### Upgrade using Composer

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "^5.0" // [tl!--]
"statamic/cms": "^6.0" // [tl!++]
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

### PHP and Laravel support
**Affects apps using PHP < 8.2 or Laravel < 11.**

- The minimum version of PHP is now 8.2.
- The minimum version of Laravel is now 11.

We highly recommend upgrading all the way to Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4.

:::tip
If you want to (semi-)automate the Laravel upgrade process, we recommend using [Laravel Shift](https://laravelshift.com/discounts/statamic-1983) (use that link for a special 19.83% discount 🤘).

### Vue 3
**Affects apps or addons that use Vue.**

We have upgraded the Control Panel's version of Vue.js from 2 to 3.

To keep this upgrade guide manageable, we have a [dedicated page for upgrading from Vue 2 to Vue 3](/upgrade-guide/vue-2-to-3).

If you do not have any custom Vue components in your app, or in your own addons, you can skip this.

### Timezones
**Affects apps using dated collections or date fields**

**If your `timezone` setting in `config/app.php` is set to `UTC`, then nothing will change for you.**

Dates remain stored in your application's timezone. But now Statamic will convert them to UTC at runtime, which makes it much easier for Statamic to localize them as needed.

This applies to dated entries or date fields.

For example, if you have your timezone set to New York (GMT-5:00) and you have a date at 10pm, when it gets converted to UTC it will be 5 hours ahead - in the next day!

```php
// config/app.php
'timezone' => 'America/New_York',
```
```yaml
# an-entry.md
my_date_field: '2025-03-06 22:00'
```
```php
$entry->my_date_field;
// 5.x: Carbon { 2025-03-06 22:00 America/New_York } [tl! --]
// 6.x: Carbon { 2025-03-07 03:00 UTC } [tl! ++]
```

::tabs
::tab antlers
```antlers
{{ my_date_field | iso_format('JJJJ') }}
5.x: Thursday, March 6, 2025 10:00 PM {{# [tl! --] #}}
6.x: Friday, March 7, 2025 3:00 AM {{# [tl! ++] #}}
```
::tab blade
```blade
{{ Statamic::modify($my_date_field)->iso_format('JJJJ') }}
5.x: Thursday, March 6, 2025 10:00 PM {{-- [tl! --] --}}
6.x: Friday, March 7, 2025 3:00 AM {{-- [tl! ++] --}}
```
::

It's best practice to keep dates as UTC until you're ready to display them, which means modifiers will deal with UTC versions. But, you can opt into automatic conversion to your display timezone by changing the following in `config/statamic/system.php`:

```php
'localize_dates_in_modifiers' => true, // [tl! ++] 
```

This settings _should_ have been automatically set to `true` by Statamic during the upgrade, but you should confirm it.

#### Control Panel
Dates in the Control Panel are now localized to the user's operating system timezone, rather than the application timezone.

For example, on Statamic 5, if you were in a different timezone to what your app was configured in, and you select a date from the date picker, that date would be treated as the date for the app's timezone. Not your timezone.

This was a common cause of confusion, which was one of the main reasons for all these changes.

Now in Statamic 6, the date you pick will be the date in **your** timezone.

There is nothing for you to change except your expectations when working with dates, and instructing your clients about it. 

#### REST API & GraphQL
Dates will now be returned by Statamic's REST API and GraphQL API in UTC, allowing you to localize them as needed on your frontend.

#### Changing your app timezone
It's best practice to set your app's timezone to UTC. However, changing the timezone in an existing project is a big undertaking and could mean lots of content and dates need to be updated.

Statamic 6 **does not** require that you change your timezone to UTC. But if you *want* to, we have provided a way to automate it.

[Read how to change your timezone to UTC](/tips/change-timezone-to-utc).

## Medium impact changes

### Carbon 3

Support for [Carbon 2.x](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/) has been removed. All Statamic 6 sites now require [Carbon 3.x](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-carbon-3).

If you're using any of Statamic's `months_ago`, `weeks_ago`, `days_ago`, `hours_ago`, `minutes_ago`, and `seconds_ago` modifiers, you will notice that they now return floats instead of integers. Comparing against past timestamps will also result in negative numbers.

You _may_ need to updates your templates to account for these changes.

## Low impact changes

### Moment.js has been removed
**Affects addons and custom code directly using moment.js**
If you are using moment.js you should replace it with an alternative. We suggest using native JS code which should be enough these days. For example:

```js
moment().seconds(); // [tl! --]
new Date().getSeconds(); // [tl! ++]
```

You should search for `moment` or `$moment` references in your code and replace appropriately.

[Here is a good resource](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs) on how to migrate away from Moment.js.

### Site methods
**Affects addons using the `Site::setConfig()` method.**

The `Site::setConfig()` method was deprecated in Statamic 5. It has now been removed. You should use the `Site::setSites()` method instead:

```php
Site::setConfig([ // [tl! remove:5]
    'sites' => [
        'english' => ['name' => 'English', 'locale' => 'en_US', 'url' => '/en'],
        'french' => ['name' => 'French', 'locale' => 'fr_FR', 'url' => '/fr'],
    ],
]);

Site::setSites([ // [tl! add:3]
    'english' => ['name' => 'English', 'locale' => 'en_US', 'url' => '/en'],
    'french' => ['name' => 'French', 'locale' => 'fr_FR', 'url' => '/fr'],
]);
```

### CP Nav Items: `->active()` method removed
**Affects apps or addons adding nav items to the Control Panel.**

When adding nav items to the Control Panel, it was previously possible to specify a regex pattern used to determine if the nav item was active. However, after some improvements in Statamic, this method is no longer needed and has been removed after a deprecation period. You can safely remove it from your nav items:

```php
Nav::extend(function ($nav) {
    $nav->create(ucfirst($type))
        ->section('SEO')
        ->route("ecommerce.orders.index")
        ->active("ecommerce/orders") // [tl! --]
        ->icon($defaults->first()['type_icon']);
});
```

### Relate tag has been removed

The `relate` tag left over from Statamic 2 has been removed. You can safely remove it and rely on [augmentation](/augmentation) instead.

```antlers
{{ relate:products }} {{# [tl! remove:2] #}}
    {{ title }} 
{{ /relate:products }}

{{ products }} {{# [tl! add:2] #}}
    {{ title }}
{{ /products }}
```
