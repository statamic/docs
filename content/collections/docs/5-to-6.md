intro: 'A guide for upgrading from 5 to 6. For most sites (those running Laravel > 10), the process will take less than 5 minutes.'

## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. While there are many items on this page, a majority of them only apply to addons or custom code. We've noted who each item would apply to so you can more easily scan through the changes.

### Upgrade using Composer

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "^5.0" // [tl!--]
"statamic/cms": "^6.0" // [tl!++]
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

### PHP and Laravel support
**Affects apps using PHP < 8.2 or Laravel < 11.**

- The minimum version of PHP is now 8.2.
- The minimum version of Laravel is now 11.

We highly recommend upgrading all the way to Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4.

:::tip
If you want to (semi-)automate the Laravel upgrade process, we recommend using [Laravel Shift](https://laravelshift.com/discounts/statamic-1983) (use that link for a special 19.83% discount ðŸ¤˜).
:::

### Vue 3
**Affects apps or addons that use Vue.**

We have upgraded the Control Panel's version of Vue.js from 2 to 3.

To keep this upgrade guide manageable, we have a [dedicated page for upgrading from Vue 2 to Vue 3](/upgrade-guide/vue-2-to-3).

If you do not have any custom Vue components in your app, or in your own addons, you can skip this.

### Timezones
**Affects apps using the Date fieldtype**

While dates are saved in your application's timezone, Statamic now converts them to UTC, which makes it much easier for Statamic to localize them, as needed.

#### Templates
If you're using the `now` variable to compare dates, you should use the `:date:gt="now"` syntax instead of `date:gt="{ now }"`.

Please see our [Timezones](/tips/timezones) guide for more information on how this change affects templating.

#### Control Panel
Dates in the Control Panel are now localized to the user's operating system timezone, rather than the application timezone.

#### Changing your app timezone
When possible, you should keep your app's timezone set to UTC.

However, if you've had to change it in the past (maybe to workaround timezone issues in Statamic), you may now safely change it back to UTC. You can use our migration command which will update date fields throughout your content:

```
php please migrate-dates-to-utc America/New_York
```

You should replace `America/New_York` with whatever timezone you want to convert dates _from_ (eg. your old app timezone). We **highly recommend** taking a backup of your site before running the command, especially if you're storing content in a database.

If you're storing content in a database, or outside of version control, you will need to run this command after deploying to production/staging.

Once complete, you may change your app's timezone in `config/app.php`:

```php
// config/app.php

/*
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Application Timezone
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | Here you may specify the default timezone for your application, which
 | will be used by the PHP date and date-time functions. The timezone
 | is set to "UTC" by default as it is suitable for most use cases.
 |
 */

'timezone' => 'America/New_York', // [tl! remove]
'timezone' => 'UTC', // [tl! add]
```

## Medium impact changes

### Carbon 3

Support for [Carbon 2.x](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/) has been removed. All Statamic 6 sites now require [Carbon 3.x](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-carbon-3).

If you're using any of Statamic's `months_ago`, `weeks_ago`, `days_ago`, `hours_ago`, `minutes_ago`, and `seconds_ago` modifiers, you will notice that they now return floats instead of integers. Comparing against past timestamps will also result in negative numbers.

You _may_ need to updates your templates to account for these changes.
