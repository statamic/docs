## Overview

Laravel Herd offers a straightforward approach to setting up your machine with all the necessary dependencies for PHP development, like a web server and Composer, and of course PHP itself. It's easier compared to using Homebrew, less error-prone, and blazingly fast. It's our preferred and recommended way to get started with Statamic and Laravel development on a Mac.

## Prerequisites

To install Herd and run Statamic locally you will need the following:

- A Macintosh running macOS 12.0+
- That's it.

## Install Laravel Herd

Installing Herd is super easy and the same process as with any other application on the Mac. Just [download the latest version](https://herd.laravel.com/download), open the `.dmg` file, and drop the app into your `Applications` folder.

</figure>

After you open it for the first time, you will get prompted to type in your user password so all the necessary files can be put in the right places.

If you previously used Laravel Valet you can migrate to Herd and all settings, like linked projects and installed PHP versions, will be synced. Didn't use Valet before? Then you won't see this screen.

</figure>

Next, you get presented with a screen saying that you can now use Herd, Composer, and more. The default location to place your projects in is `~/Herd` which you can change in the settings if you like. You can also choose to automatically launch Herd on startup which we would recommend.

After that's done, Herd has been successfully installed and you now have a local PHP development environment on your machine.

If you want to install additional PHP versions or make your local sites available through [Expose](http://expose.dev/) via secure tunnels, open the Herd settings to get access to a range of different options.

## Install Statamic CLI

Next up on your journey to greatness is installing the Statamic CLI. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

``` shell
composer global require statamic/cli
```

Upon installation, you can now use the `statamic new` command to spin up fresh Statamic sites with a CLI setup wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to guide you through a variety of settings and options.

Our CLI is essentially a super fancy wrapper around the `composer create-project` command. You can choose to not install it. Though it offers a wide range of really neat features and we recommend it.

## Create a new site

Let's take the last big step toward you enjoying all of Statamic's radness‚Ñ¢.

In your terminal, run `statamic new your-project-name` and follow the prompts to create a new site.

</figure>

For a more in-depth guide on using the CLI and all of its options, have a look at [its docs](/cli).

## Access the site

Sweet, if you did all the previous steps you should now be able to open your site at  `http://your-project-name.test`.

<figure>

</figure>

The Control Panel, Statamic's admin area, can be accessed at `/cp` where you can log in with the user you created during the CLI's setup wizard.

## What's Next

Well done, you have turned your computer into a local PHP development environment, installed the Statamic CLI, and set up your first Statamic site! üéâ

Get creative, explore everything, and build something rad.

Use all of Statamic's Pro features while in development (like unlimited users, permissions, GraphQL, REST API, and more), by setting `'pro' => true` in `config/statamic/editions.php`.
