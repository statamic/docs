## Clarification

The **frontend** of a website is the part users see and interact with in their browser. The .com bit. It's the text, images, videos, pages, layouts, RSS feeds, and other bits that your readers and visitors consume.

It's likely this isn't new information – most people who read these docs are developers with front-end experience. Please keep reading though! There's good info in here.

When we refer to the frontend of a _Statamic_ site, we're talking about the templates and views, JavaScript/CSS files, media assets, and other resources used to render your final website.

The **backend** of a Statamic site is all of the PHP and Laravel code that you _can_ customize and extend to bring your own unique features and capabilities to life on your site.

Statamic's **Control Panel** sits _outside_ both the frontend and backend as a tool used to publish and manage content, users, and assets.

## The Frontend is Yours

In today's tech-driven ecosystem there are countless ways to build a website. Some might say _too_ many. You could...

- Write a Single Page Application (SPA) with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) or [React](https://reactjs.org) to run your entire site without the need for page refreshes
- Use HTML and Statamic's [Antlers](/antlers) template language to build a dynamic site with smart caching
- Use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Laravel Mix][mix], or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to compile your JavaScript and SCSS/LESS
- Go for the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) approach and run a statically generated site without server-side processing
- Build a standard Statamic site and deploy a static version to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
- Go skateboarding and stay away from computers and nerdy webmasters
- <span class="font-display">Kick it old-school and write your own HTML, plain CSS, and vanilla JavaScript</span>

Just like the [honey badger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg), Statamic don't care. You can take any of these approaches or one of many others — including several that will be invented tomorrow and forgotten by autumn.

**It's up to you.** Write or generate HTML somehow and let Statamic get it to the browser.

## Path of Least Resistance

If you don't have a hard requirement, a strong preference, or just want our advice, we recommend writing your own HTML, use [Antlers](/antlers) in said HTML to pull content in, use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as your CSS framework, and let [Laravel Mix][mix] compile any JavaScript, SCSS/LESS, or PostCSS as necessary.

You'll be able to take advantage of all of our powerful, tightly coupled [tags](/tags) that do most of the heavy lifting — like fetching and displaying content from collections and taxonomies, manipulating, assets, and rendering variables.

## Other Options

You don't have to go Antlers + Tailwind. At all. That's just our preference.

You could do so many different things, like:

- Use our [GraphQL](/graphql) integration and build your frontend with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- Use our [REST API](/rest-api) and build a single page application with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) or [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Use [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade) and some controllers and write your own routes.

It's up to you.

## Request Lifecycle

Let's take a quick look at what happens during a typical Statamic frontend request:

1. User visits a URL.
2. Statamic checks if there's any data matching the URL (e.g. an [entry](/collections) or [route](/routing#statamic-routes)).
3. [Variables](/variables) for that item are fetched out the data store.
4. Statamic loads the appropriate [view](/views) and injects the variables into it.
5. The Contents of the rendered view is sent to the user's browser.
