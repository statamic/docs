## Creating a new Statamic project?

If you want to start from scratch, use Composer to create a project based off the [`statamic/statamic`](https://github.com/statamic/statamic) starter site.

``` bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist statamic/statamic {change_me}
```

_(hint: replace `{change_me}` with whatever you'd like to name your site.)_

After you've installed, make sure to point your web server to your `public` folder. If you use Laravel Valet, that will be automatically picked up.

### Starter Kits

You can also use one of the starter kits to jump ahead with a pre-built site. Each starter kit has its own installation docs.

- [Cool Writings](https://github.com/statamic/starter-kit-cool-writings)
- [Doogie Browser](https://github.com/statamic/starter-kit-doogie-browser)

## You can also install into an _existing_ Laravel app {#exising-laravel}

1. Add the `statamic:install` command to `post-autoload-dump` in `composer.json`.

    ``` json
    "post-autoload-dump": [
        "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
        "@php artisan package:discover --ansi",
        "@php artisan statamic:install --ansi"
    ],
    ```

2. Require `statamic/cms`.

   ``` bash
   composer require statamic/cms
   ```

3. If you have existing users in your application, [follow these instructions](/users#storage) to learn how to make them compatible with Statamic, or how to switch to Statamic's file-based user driver.

After Statamic is installed, you'll have the `content/`, `users/`, and `config/statamic` directories added to your project. Your app will continue to work as before and you'll have Statamic available at your fingertips.

Your explicit routes will take precedence and anything not caught by your app will run through Statamic and will work as documented. Enjoy!

## Next Steps

Once you've installed Statamic, you're ready to start building! Check out the [Quick Start](/quick-start) page for a walkthrough on how to build a simple site, access the Control Panel, creating a user, and more.

> If you want to use Pro features while in development (like users, permissions & groups, revisions, and git integration), set `'pro' => true` in `config/statamic/editions.php`.

Want to jump right in? You can create a user by running `php please make:user`, and heading to `http://yoursite.com/cp`.

## Updating

Statamic is updated using Composer either directly on the command line or through the Control Panel.

### Command Line

From within your project, use Composer to update the Statamic CMS package:

``` bash
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

You may prefer to run `composer update` to update _all_ of your dependencies listed in your composer.json file

### Control Panel

You may also update Statamic from within the Control Panel. Head to the "Updates" section and click update.

> Updating via the CP will lock that specific version of `statamic/cms` in your `composer.json`. If you want to update using
> the command line later, you'll need to update the version manually before running `composer update`.
