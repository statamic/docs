intro: 'A guide for upgrading from 3.3 to 3.4. For most sites, the process will take less than 5 minutes.'

## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. When upgrading, Statamic may automate some things for you. They'll be noted below.

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "3.4.*"
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

### The runtime Antlers parser is the default

In 3.3 we introduced a new Antlers parser but you had to opt into it.

In 3.4 it becomes the default.

You may continue to use the old "regex" parser, but you'll need to make sure to specify that in `config/statamic/antlers.php`.

```php
'version' => 'regex', // or "runtime" for the new parser
```

## Medium impact changes

## Low impact changes

### Slugs no longer include extra characters

In some forms, the slug will get automatically generated. e.g. When you type into the `title` field on a publish form.

In 3.3, some special characters would get converted. e.g. The `&` would become `and`.

In 3.4, **these characters will not get converted**.

To enable these character conversions, you can enable a new setting in `config/statamic/system.php`.

```php
'ascii_replace_extra_symbols' => true,
```

### Replicator, Bard, and Grid IDs

All three fieldtypes will now supply their `id` to templates. Previously the, the `id` would have been the entry's ID.

If you still need to access the entry's ID within the field tag pair, you may use the `page` variable:

```
{{ grid }}
    {{ id }} the entry id {{# [tl! --] #}}
    {{ id }} the grid item's id {{# [tl! ++] #}}
    {{ page:id }} the entry id {{# [tl! ++] #}}
{{ /grid }}
```
