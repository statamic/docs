## Overview

Deployments are the process of moving the Statamic site you've built — whether on your local computer or distributed across a team — to the production (aka "live") server for the whole world (wide web) to see.

At its most simple level, it's just the act of moving files from your computer to another computer — the web server. There are many ways to do it, from a slow and painfully manual FTP upload (please don't), to a lightning quick git push with auto-deployment.

The deployment options available to you will depend on the type of hosting scenario you're using.
