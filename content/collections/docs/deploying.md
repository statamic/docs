## Overview

Deployments are the process of moving the Statamic site you've built — whether on your local computer or distributed across a team — to the production (aka "live") server for the whole world (wide web) to see.

At its most simple level, it's just the act moving files from your computer to another computer — the web server. There are many ways to do it, from a slow and painfully manual FTP upload (please don't), to a lightning quick git push with auto-deployment.

The deployment options available to you will depend on the type of hosting scenario you're using.
