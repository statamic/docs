title: Requirements
intro: Statamic is a modern PHP application, built as a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) package, and has the same server requirements as &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; Laravel itself. To manipulate images (resize, crop, etc), you will also need the GD Library or ImageMagick.

## Server Requirements

To run Statamic 3 you'll need a server meeting the following requirements. These are all pretty standard in most modern hosting platforms.

- PHP `>= 7.2.5`
- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Exif PHP Extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension
- GD Library or ImageMagick

## Recommended Hosts

We recommend using [Digital Ocean][do] to host most Statamic sites. Their servers are fast, inexpensive, and we use them ourselves. _**Full disclosure:** that's an affiliate link but we wouldn't recommend them if it wasn't an excellent option._

We also maintain a user-contributed [Github repo][hosts] full of other host recommendations.

## Development Environments

All of these requirements are satisfied by the [Laravel Homestead][homestead] virtual machine, which makes it a great local Laravel development environment. Virtual machines aren't for everybody though, so here are a couple of other options.

### MacOS: Laravel Valet

[Laravel Valet][valet] is a development environment for Mac minimalists. No Vagrant, No Apache, No Nginx, No need to manually edit hosts file. It simply maps all the subdirectories in a “web” directory (such as `~/Sites`) to `.test` or `.localhost` domains.

You can even share your sites publicly using local tunnels. We use it ourselves and it’s brilliant.

### Windows: WAMP

[Laragon][laragon] and [WAMP][wamp] are both good choice for those of the Windows persuasion.
