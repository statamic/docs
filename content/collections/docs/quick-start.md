## Overview

Much of the documentation is intended to be used as a reference sheet for various features, explaining how they work and what options and settings they provide. But not this guide. This is for glueing it all together, assuming you know very little about how Statamic works. We'll only make a couple of assumptions here before we get started.

1. You are comfortable working with HTML.
2. You have a local dev environment with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.
3. You can copy and paste a few commands into the command line.
4. You have more than 5 minutes to spare. Let's enjoy ourselves here.

### What we're building

We're going to build a simple personal website for a fictitious young aspiring programmer named Kurt Logan. Kurt always has and always will live in the 1980s and is very excited at the prospect of having his very own place in <span class="uppercase font-bold tracking-widest text-green font-display">Cyberspace</span>.

## High level approach

A high level approach to building a site in Statamic usually looks like this.

1. Start with a static HTML site or series of different layouts
2. Break static files up into the appropriate [Antlers views](/antlers) (layouts, templates, and partials)
3. Create applicable [collections](/collections) and [routes](/routing) to hold content
4. Stub out top level pages and map them to the proper templates
5. Add fields to your [blueprints](/blueprints) and start moving static content from HTML into their proper fields
6. Keep going until your site is done!

Once familiar with Statamic, many developers begin building their static site right in Statamic, often blending all the steps into a smooth flowing river of productivity.

## Install Statamic

Let's start right at the very beginning. Installing Statamic.

First, we're going to [`composer create-project`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#create-project) command from the command line. This clones the [statamic/statamic repo](https://github.com/statamic/statamic) and then runs a series of scripts on it to automate steps you would otherwise need to perform manually if you cloned the repo directly. Nice.

You should run this command from your `~/Sites` directory if you're using [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) or a similar dev environment where directories map to `.test` local domains.

``` bash
composer create-project statamic/statamic cyberspace-place --prefer-dist --stability=dev
```

If everything worked as expected, you should be able to visit [http://cyberspace-place.test](http://cyberspace-place.test) and see the Statamic 3 welcome screen.

If you encounter a 404 error, make sure your `APP_URL` is set correctly in the `.env` file.

If you encounter any other errors, Google them frantically and try anything and everything suggested until it magically begins working.

Just kidding, that's a terrible idea. Please don't do that. You should check our [knowledge base](/knowledge-base) and [forums](https://statamic.com/forums) to look for a validated solution before resorting to such measures.

</figure>

Next, in your command line navigate into the new site (`cd cyberspace-place`) and open the project directory in your code editor.

## Create your first user

Now we can create a new super user and sign into the control panel and start creating some content to display on the frontend.

Run `php please make:user` from the command line inside that new project directory and follow along with the prompts (name, email, etc). Be sure to say `yes` when asked if the user should be a **super user** otherwise you'll just have to do it again. And again. And again until you finally say `yes`. Never be afraid of committing to success.

</figure>

Now you can sign in! Head to [http://cyberspace-place.test/cp](http://cyberspace-place.test/cp) and use your email address and password to sign into the control panel.

</figure>

## Make a home page

Next, let's get some content of _our_ choosing to show on the homepage. Head to `Collections â†’ Pages` in the control panel and you'll see an empty home page entry waiting for you. Click on the entry's title to edit it. Type anything you want in the `content` field and then click **Save & Publish**.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/editing-home.png" alt="Editing the home page">
    <figcaption>Don't overthink it. Just type some aedgaeduhadfubugra</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that the entry is using the `home` template (you can see it there in the `template` field). Let's edit it and reveal your new and incredible content to the browser.

In your code editor, open the file `resources/views/home.antlers.html`. This is the home template. The name of a template is the filename _up until the file extension_. Any view ending in `.antlers.html` will be parsed with Statamic's [Antlers](/antlers) template parser.

> If a view file ends with `.blade.php` it will use Laravel's [Blade language](/template-engines). This same pattern applies for other template engines that could be installed in the future.

Delete all the placeholder HTML from the template and replace it with the following:

```
{{ content }}
```

Refresh the site in your browser and you should see your content in all of its glory. Each of those double curly tags is a **variable**. When on a URL that's loading content from an entry, all of the content fields are available to you with their corresponding variable name (also called a "handle"). We'll get into adding new fields in just a bit.

    <img src="/img/quick-start/new-home.png" alt="Your new home page" width="424">
    <figcaption>What did you write? Was it a dad joke?</figcaption>
</figure>

## Customize the Layout

You probably noticed that there is some _very_ basic styling going on. That's coming from the **layout**. Time to customize that too. Open `resources/views/layout.antlers.html` and replace it with this:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^1.0/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-900 text-white text-lg font-mono">
    <div class="container max-w-lg mx-auto py-8">
        {{ template_content }}
    </div>
</body>
</html>

```

Your layout file contains any markup you want present no matter what page youâ€™re on, where you go, how far you travel, or loudly you sing. It's the perfect place to put your `<head>` stuff, main site nav, and site footer bits.

You can think of layouts like **picture frames** for your website. Everything you want rendered into the _contents_ of the frame â€” those things that may change from section to section and page to page â€”Â goes into templates. Those templates are rendered wherever you put that `{{ template_content }}` variable in your layout.

</figure>


## Create an About page

Let's make our first _new_ page! Head back to our Dashboard to `Collections -> Pages` to add our new page. Above our table with our Home page click the **Create Entry** button.

We're dropped into a blank Page form just like our Home page form from before. Here we'll create our new page just as we did before.

You can add any title you like in the `title` box based on search engine optimization, marketing, and other wizardry; for now, we'll stick with "About".

Next, add a catchy description in the `content` box, something like "The greatest professional wrestling fan site, OOOOH YEAAAH!"

Now, scroll down to Template. From the drop down we have several options. We used "home" for our Home page, now let's select "default" for our About page.

Click **Save & Publish** and you'll see your new page titled "About" in the List.
