## Overview

Much of the documentation is intended to be used as a reference sheet for various features, explaining how they work and what options and settings they provide. But not this guide. This is for glueing it all together, assuming you know very little about how Statamic works. We'll only make a couple of assumptions here before we get started.

1. You are comfortable working with HTML.
2. You have a local dev environment with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.
3. You can copy and paste a few commands into the command line.
4. You have more than 5 minutes to spare. Let's enjoy ourselves here.

### What we're building

We're going to build a simple personal website for a fictitious young aspiring programmer named Kurt Logan. Kurt always has and always will live in the 1980s and is very excited at the prospect of having his very own place in <span class="uppercase font-bold tracking-widest text-green font-display">Cyberspace</span>.

## High level approach

A high level approach to building a site in Statamic often looks like this.

1. Start with a static HTML site or series of different layouts
2. Break static files up into the appropriate [Antlers views](/antlers) (layouts, templates, and partials)
3. Create applicable [collections](/collections) to hold content and set up [routes](/routing) to determine your URL patterns
4. Stub out top level pages and map them to the proper templates
5. Configure [blueprints](/blueprints) to hold fields that match your HTML (like title, author, date, content) and move static content out of your markup and into entries using the beautiful UI
6. Keep going until your site is done

Once familiar with Statamic, many developers begin building their static site right in Statamic, often blending all the steps into a smooth flowing river of productivity.

<!-- ## Prerequisites

We want this quick start guide to be just that â€” quick. Rather than stop after each of the first steps to explain development environment stuff, we recommend you follow the [Getting Your Development Environment Up & Running](#) guide first to make sure you're ready to run Statamic on your machine. -->

## Install Statamic

Let's start right at the very beginning. Installing Statamic.

There are a [few ways to do it](/installing), but we'll just go with the simplest, most copy & pasteable method â€“Â using [Composer's](https://getcomposer.org) `create-project` command.

The command you're about to run clones (makes a copy of) our [empty starter site](https://github.com/statamic/statamic) and then runs a few automated scripts to get your new blank site ready.

You should run this command from your Terminal application of choice (we like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) inside your `~/Sites` directory or wherever you prefer putting your sites.

``` shell
composer create-project --prefer-dist statamic/statamic cyberspace-place
```

If everything worked as expected, you should be able to visit [http://cyberspace-place.test](http://cyberspace-place.test) and see the Statamic 3 welcome screen.

If you encounter a 404 error, make sure your `APP_URL` is set correctly in the `.env` file. If you encounter a Composer error, try running `composer global update` and trying again.

If you encounter any other errors, Google them frantically and try anything and everything suggested until it magically begins working.

**Just kidding**, that's a terrible idea. Please don't do that. You should check our [troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) guide and [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/statamic/cms/discussions) to look for a validated solution before resorting to such measures. We try our best to have answers to all the most common things you might encounter. Modern web development is amazing when everything is up to date, and can be pretty frustrating when it isn't. We feel this pain too.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/installed-3.3.png" alt="Statamic 3 Welcome Screen">
    <figcaption><a class="no-underline hover:text-pink-hot font-bold text-blue-darkest">If you see this you are right on track.</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Next, in your command line navigate into the new site (`cd cyberspace-place`) and open the project directory in your code editor. We like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but there are a ton of great editors and IDEs out there.

## Create your first user

Now we can create a new **super user**, sign into the control panel, and start creating content to display on the frontend.

Run `php please make:user` from the command line and follow along with the prompts (name, email, etc). Be sure to say `yes` when asked if the user should be a **super user** otherwise you'll just have to do it again. And again. And again until you finally say `yes`. Never be afraid of committing to success.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/make-user.png" alt="Statamic 3 Make:User Command" width="453">
    <figcaption>You can customize user fields later.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now you can sign in. Head to [http://cyberspace-place.test/cp](http://cyberspace-place.test/cp) and use your email address and password to sign into the control panel.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/login.png" alt="Statamic 3 Login Screen">
    <figcaption>If you see this screen at <code>/cp</code> you've just earned 200 XP!</figcaption>
</figure>

## Make a home page

Next, let's get some content of _our_ choosing to show on the homepage. Head to `Collections â†’ Pages` in the control panel and you'll see an empty home page entry waiting for you. Click on the entry's title to edit it. Type anything you want in the `content` field and then click **Save & Publish**.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/editing-home.png" alt="Editing the home page">
    <figcaption>Don't overthink it. Just type some aedgaeduhadfubugra</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that the entry is using the `home` template (you can see it there in the `template` field). Let's edit it and reveal your new and incredible content to the browser.

In your code editor, open the file `resources/views/home.antlers.html`. This is the home template. The "name" of a template is the filename _up until the file extension_. Any view ending in `.antlers.html` will be parsed with Statamic's [Antlers](/antlers) template parser.

:::tip
If a view file ends with `.blade.php` it will use Laravel's [Blade language](/blade). This same pattern applies for other template engines that could be installed in the future.
:::

Delete all the placeholder HTML from the template and replace it with the following:

```
{{ content }}
```

Refresh the site in your browser and you should see your content in all of its glory. Each of those double curly tags is a **variable**. When on a URL that matches an entry's route rule, all of that entry's field data is available automatically in the defined template. We'll get into adding new fields in just a bit.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/new-home.png" alt="Your new home page" width="424">
    <figcaption>What did you write? Was it a dad joke?</figcaption>
</figure>

## Customize the Layout

You probably noticed that there is some _very_ basic styling going on. That's coming from the **layout**. Time to customize that too. Open `resources/views/layout.antlers.html` and replace it with this:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-900 text-white text-lg font-mono">
    <div class="container max-w-lg mx-auto py-8">
        {{ template_content }}
    </div>
</body>
</html>

```

Your layout file contains any markup you want present no matter what page youâ€™re on. It's usually the best place to put your `<head>` meta markup, persistent site navigation, site footer, and other global things.

Think of layouts like a **picture frame**, and everything that changes from section to section, page to page _inside_ the frame â€” goes into templates. In practice, templates are injected inline wherever you put a `{{ template_content }}` variable in your layout to create a complete HTML document.


<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/new-layout.png" alt="Your new layout" width="603">
    <figcaption>If copy & pasted properly you should see this ðŸ‘†</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip
There's really no perfect place to mention this, but here is as good as any.

The default install uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) in Just In Time mode, so anytime you change classes in your HTML you'll need to recompile your CSS.

This is super easy and happens automatically when you run `npm run watch` from the terminal in your project directory (as long as you've run `npm install` first).
:::

## Now let's build a blog

You might have known it was coming next â€“Â it's the staple of every CMS walkthrough. How easy is it to build a blog? You're about to find out.

But first, let's talk about what a blog is. A "blog" is a collection of posts that shares common traits or attributes. A typical blog post might contain a title, featured image, an author, a few tags, andÂ the article content.

There also always a list (sometimes called an "archive") of blog posts linking to each post's unique URL, and sometimes the homepage has a short list of the most recent posts as well. Let's detail exactly what we're going to build, and then build it.

Here's our todo list:

- Create a blog "Collection" with the following fields: `title` , `featured_image` , `author` , and `content`
- Create a blog index page (`/blog`)
- Create a blog detail page (`/blog/why-i-love-mustard`)
- Add a list of the most recent 5 blog entries to the homepage

### Create a new Collection

Head back to the Control Panel and click on the Collections link in the sidebar. Click the blue **Create Collection** button and then call your new collection "Blog".

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/create-collection.jpg" alt="Creating a blog collection" width="600">
    <figcaption>Name it whatever you want, as long as you name it Blog.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Scaffold your views

Let's save you a minute or two and generate the index and show template. Click on **Scaffold Views**

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/scaffold-views-link.jpg" alt="Link to Scaffold Views" width="600">
    <figcaption>Click it.</figcaption>
</figure>

And then click the Create Views button. The defaults are perfect.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/scaffold-views.jpg" alt="Scaffold collection views" width="600">
    <figcaption>Click the button.</figcaption>
</figure>

Two new files will be created. We'll be editing them soon:

- `resources/views/blog/index.antlers.html`
- `resources/views/blog/show.antlers.html`

## Configure the collection

Next, let's configure the collection to behave the way a typical blog should. Click **Configure Collection**.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/configure-collection-link.jpg" alt="Link to configure your collection" width="600">
    <figcaption>And now click this.</figcaption>
</figure>


:::tip
Statamic does its best to take a "start simple and add things as needed" approach to features and settings, in contrast to other platforms that take a "everything is included and rip it what you don't want" approach.

This means that Statamic doesn't do everything right out the box, but is much simpler to customize how you want everything to work.
:::

We'll review some of the important settings, but we only need to touch two of them to make a blog:

- Enable Publish Dates (the subs-setting defaults are perfect)
- Set your route rule

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/blog-settings.jpg" alt="Settings to make a blog" width="600">
    <figcaption>These are the only two you need to set.</figcaption>
</figure>

By enabling **Publish Dates**, Statamic will add a date field to your list of available entry fields (called a Blueprint), and will use the specified date to determine whether a given entry should be visible or not. Typical blog posts with a date in the future would be a _scheduled_ post and not yet published, and one in the past is published, and therefore visible. This is how we'll configure our Blog Collection, and is the default behavior when you enable this feature.

As you scroll you'll notice a **Content Model** section. That template you scaffolded in the previous step is automatically selected as the default template for new Blog entries.

And finally in the **Routing & URLs** section you'll find the **Route** setting. Here you can create the URL pattern that all of your entries will follow. You can change this anytime and use any of the Collection's fields as variables in the pattern by surrounding them in single braces, `{like_this}`.

Here are some common patterns you could choose from:

| Example URL | Route Pattern Rule |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|`/blog/2021-12-24/merry-christmas` | `/blog/{year}-{month}-{day}/{slug}` |
|`/blog/2020/still-bored` | `/blog/{year}/{slug}` |
|`/blog/happy-new-year` | `/blog/{slug}` |
| `/evergreen-syle` | `/{slug}` |

:::tip
Check out the full list of [available variables](/collections#meta-variables). Try saying "available variables" 3x fast. It's not the _best_ tongue-twister, but it does qualify.
:::

When in doubt, keep it simple. And then save your changes.

## Creating your first entry

We like to make things work and then make them better. With that in mind, let's make our first blog post and get it to show on the frontend before we configure all the custom fields and whatnot.

Head back to your blog Collection screen and click **Create Entry**.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/create-entry-link.jpg" alt="Link to create your first blog entry" width="600">
    <figcaption>And finally, click this.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now you can see all the default fields for your new Collection. They're the same as the Home entry you edited a few moments ago. Go ahead and make a new blog post. Make two if you'd like! It's up to you.

| Field | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Title** | The required title of the entry |
| **Content** |Â A simple [Markdown](/fieldtypes/markdown) field |
| **Author** | Defaults to whoever is logged in |
| **Template** | When not _explicitly set_ will use the Collection's default |
| **Slug** | Automatically generated off the title until you edit it manually |
| **Date** | Defaults to today |

## Time for more frontend

It's code editor time! Let's get that list of the 5 most recent entries onto the homepage since it already exists and is one of our todos. Open `resources/views/home.antlers.html` and replace that lonely `{{ content }}` with this markup (don't worry, we'll explain what's going on in a moment):

```
// resources/views/home.antlers.html

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold my-6">Welcome to my CyberSpace Place!</h1>
{{ content }}

<section class="border border-green-400 mt-12">
    <h2 class="p-5">Recent Blog Posts</h2>
    {{ collection:blog limit="5" }}
        <a href="{{ url }}" class="flex items-center justify-between p-5 border-t border-green-400 text-green-400 hover:text-green-900 hover:bg-green-400">
            <span>{{ title }}</span>
            <span class="text-green-900 text-sm">{{ date }}</span>
        </a>
    {{ /collection:blog }}
</section>
```

If you refresh your homepage (and managed to name your placeholder entry or two the same as us), you should see this:

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/new-homepage.jpg" alt="Link to create your first blog entry" width="600">
    <figcaption>We said it would look ugly, but we lied.</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's take a closer look at how this works. Stripping out all the styling in the example, here's the most basic [Antlers](/antlers) template snippet that fetches your entries.

```
{{ collection:blog limit="5" }}
    <a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a>
{{ /collection:blog }}
```

Here you can see we're telling the [Collection Tag](/tags/collection) tag to use the `blog` collection and limit the number of returned entries to 5. Inside the tag pair is a loop that iterates over each entry with access to all the data available as `{{ variables }}`.

The `url` will follow the pattern you set in the route rule (`/blog/hello-from-cyberspace` perhaps?) and if you were to click it, you'd see a new page using the `resources/views/blog/show.antlers.html` template, which is empty so there's not much to look at. Let's edit that next.

## The blog "show" template

Now that we're on an entry's very own unique URL, you no longer need that `{{ collection:blog }}` tag pair to fetch data. All of the entry's data is available automatically. Here's a really simple snippet you can drop in so you can see the data pull through.

```
// resources/views/blog/show.antlers.html

<h1 class="text-3xl bg-green-400 text-center text-green-900 font-bold mt-6 p-6">{{ title }}</h1>
<div class="border text-center text-green-600 border-green-400 mt-8 p-3 text-xs uppercase">
    Published on {{ date }} by {{ author:name }}
</div>

<article class="space-y-4 mt-8 text-sm text-green-400 leading-loose">
    {{ content }}
</article>
```

A few cool things to note here in this code example:

- The author's `name` is being accessed by reaching into the `{{ author }}` object. You can retrieve any data (but not password) on a user this way. Pretty cool.
- The `content` field is being automatically converted from Markdown to HTML because we're using a [Markdown](/fieldtypes/markdown) field. If you were to use a generic [Textarea](/fieldtypes/textarea) field, you'd need to transform the Markdown yourself by using a [modifier](/modifiers). It would look like this: `{{ textarea | markdown }}`.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/blog-show.jpg" alt="A blog post" width="600">
    <figcaption>How close does your look?</figcaption>
</figure>


## Blog Index

Next, let's make that blog index page. Head back to the control panel and go to the **Pages** collection. Create a new entry and call it "Blog", "My Blog", or even "My CyberBlog" â€”Â just make sure the slug is `blog`. Set the template to `blog/index`.

Back to your code editor â€” open up the `resources/views/blog/index.antlers.html` template and drop in this snippet. It's essentially what we built on the home page, but without the limit.

```
// resources/views/blog/index.antlers.html

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold my-6">{{ title }}</h1>
{{ content }}

<section class="border border-green-400 mt-12">
{{ collection:blog }}
    <a href="{{ url }}" class="flex items-center justify-between p-5 border-t border-green-400 text-green-400 hover:text-green-900 hover:bg-green-400">
        <span>{{ title }}</span>
        <span class="text-green-900 text-sm">{{ date }}</span>
    </a>
{{ /collection:blog }}
</section>
```

And stop right there. We've now duplicated a whole chunk of code save for one little tiny bit â€”Â `limit="5'`. Let's DRY this up (reduce code duplication).

:::tip
It's totally fine to duplicate code sometimes, especially if you have to make some code significantly more complex to reuse it. Just keep that in mind. We'll keep this simple.
:::

## Your first partial

Partials are reusable template chunks. Create a new file named `_listing.antlers.html` in the `resources/views/blog/` directory. Prefixing a template with an underscore is a common convention to indicate that it's a reusable partial and not a full layout. You could also create a subdirectory named `partials` â€” it's up to you. Just be consistent.

Inside that new template file, copy and paste the entire `<section>` chunk that includes the Collection tag pair from either the homepage or blog index. Or this guide. We can create a variable on the fly here so when you use your partial you can specify your desired limit. Replace that second line with this:

```
{{ collection:blog :limit="limit" }}
```

By prefixing the `limit` parameter with a colon we're telling Statamic to look for a variable named "limit" as the argument. If there isn't one it will be null, and not add a limit â€”Â just how we want it on the blog index template.

Your blog index template can now look like as simple as this:

```
// resources/views/blog/index.antlers.html

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold my-6">{{ title }}</h1>
{{ content }}
{{ partial:blog/listing }}
```

Now let's dry up the home template. We know we need to pass that limit in, but if you recall (or visit the homepage), we had that extra `<h2>` above the `collection:blog` tag. This is a perfect opportunity to add a "slot".

Switch to your new `blog/listing` partial and add `{{ slot }}` to the line right above the collection tag, like so:

```
// resources/views/blog/_listing.antlers.html

<section class="border border-green-400 mt-12">
    {{ slot }}
    {{ collection:blog :limit="limit" }}
...
```

Back in your `home` template, you can now replace that chunk of markup with a call to the partial, setting the limit, and using it as a tag pair to send the contents in as the `slot`. A super helpful little pattern.

Here's your entire home template:

```
// resources/views/home.antlers.html

<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold my-6">Welcome to my CyberSpace Place!</h1>
{{ content }}
{{ partial:blog/listing limit="5" }}
    <h2 class="p-5">Recent Blog Posts</h2>
{{ /partial:blog/listing }}
```

## The nav

We're almost done, but before we head back to the control panel to add a few more fields to your blog blueprint, let's add a nav.

Your `home` and `blog` entries are both in an "ordered" Pages collection. If you look at this default collection's config you'll see that it has the **Orderable** setting on and that the root page is considered the home page. This let's you have a page with a slug of `/`.

We can use the [Nav tag](/tags/nav) to fetch the entries in the Pages collection in the order you have them arranged.

Open up your layout file and drop in this nav snippet, right after the open body tag.

```
// resources/views/layout.antlers.html
// ...

<nav class="bg-black text-xs uppercase text-green text-center flex items-center justify-center space-x-4">
    {{ nav from="pages" include_home="true" }}
        <a href="{{ url }}" class="p-2 block hover:text-yellow-200">{{ title }}</a>
    {{ /nav  }}
</nav>
```

The nav tag works very much like the `collections` tag. It loops through the entries and gives you access to all the data inside each.

## Customizing your blueprint

We've got a pretty functional site going here, but so far we've only worked with default fields. Few sites can be so simple, so let's spice it up a bit.

Head to the **Blueprints** area in the sidebar and click **Blog**. Now you're looking at all the fields you've been working with, organized into Tab Sections.

Tab Sections let you group fields into Tabs which can help you stay organized, keep similar fields together, or help push optional, unusual fields out of mind for most authors. It's up to you how you'd like to organize these.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/blueprint-sections.jpg" alt="A Blueprint and its default fields" width="600">
    <figcaption>This is content modeling right here.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can drag, drop, and rearrange fields inside and across your sections. This order will be how you see the fields in the publish screen.

:::tip
**The Sidebar** is a special section. It controls the fields shown in the publish sidebar when your browser is wide enough, and collapses those fields to a tab when it isn't. If you delete the Sidebar section, you won't have one â€”Â and if you create a new one called "Sidebar", it'll work just as before.
:::

Let's create a new field called `featured_image`.

Click **Create Field** in the **Main** section and behold! A big list of fieldtypes! You can learn more about [each Fieldtype](/fieldtypes) elsewhere in the docs, but here are a few quick tips on narrowing down what you're looking for.

When this screen is opened, you're automatically focused in the search box, so you can start typing the fieldtype name if you know it (Hint: you could type `assets` now). Or, you can narrow the fields down by type â€“ All, Text, Media, and Relationship. You'd find the Assets fieldtype inside Media.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/fieldtypes.jpg" alt="A list of Statamic's fieldtypes" width="600">
    <figcaption>Over 40 different types to pick from!</figcaption>
</figure>

Find the **Assets** fieldtype and click it. Assets fields let you pick from and upload new files.

Next, give the field the `Display` name "Featured Image" and you'll see the `Handle` get slugified automatically to `featured_image`. This will be the variable name you will use in your templates to get the asset's data. The only additional setting you should tweak for now is to set `Max Files` to `1`. When you're done, click **Finish**.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/fieldtype-config.jpg" alt="Configuring an Assets fieldtype" width="547">
    <figcaption>Every fieldtype has shared & unique options.</figcaption>
</figure>

Head back to your Blog collection and edit an entry (or create a new one if you'd like). You'll see your new field right there. Upload any image you have on your computer. If you need a dummy image, we recommend Google Image Searching for "rad 90s kid bedroom". That's a gold mine right there.

Hover over the thumbnail for your new image and click the Edit button (it looks like a pencil). There you can make a few adjustments to the image â€“Â like setting an Alt tag.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/quick-start/asset-editor.jpg" alt="Adding an Alt tag to an image" width="547">
    <figcaption>Ducktails!</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip
Assets can have Blueprints too!
:::

When you're done, **Save & Publish** your changes.

## Wiring up the new field

Head back to `resources/views/blog/show.antlers.html` in your code editor. Add the following snippet anywhere you'd like in the template. Either before or after the `{{ content }}` variable is probably a good place.

```
// resources/views/blog/show.antlers.html
// ...

<img src="{{ featured_image }}" class="border-2 border-green-400 p-1" alt="{{ featured_image:alt }}" />
```

Refresh the page and there you have it â€”Â a basic but fully functional website. Hopefully you'll have a better idea how the basics fit together, as well as the relationship between the control panel and the frontend. There are so many more things you can do â€“Â like add [Taxonomies](/taxonomies), [Forms](/forms), [dynamic image manipulations](/tags/glide), fetch data with JavaScript with our [Content API](/rest-api) and on and on.

And make sure to not miss the list of [Tags](/tags) and [Modifiers](/modifiers) that do all sorts of powerful things in your templates.

## Going Deeper

We have a screencast series that covers getting started but goes much further and deeper. Feel free to [check that out here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVZTm2PNrzMwYLGotkQvTvjsXAkANJIkc). Good luck!
