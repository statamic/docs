## Overview

There are many reasons why you might want to install Statamic into an existing Laravel application. You could use Statamic to:

- handle all the marketing and "logged out" content for a SaaS app
- add an easy-to-manage blog the whole team can update
- manage existing data kinda like [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/) (yes, [you can do that](/extending/repositories)),
- run as a headless CMS and provide a REST API to your data
- be a special comfort package for those tough projects even when you don't need it

:::tip
If you're starting a brand new project, it's much easier to use the [standard Statamic installation method](/installing/local).

You'll get a bunch of things automatically set up for you, like a pages collection, views, etc. If you install Statamic _into_ Laravel, you're going to have to do those things manually.

## Supported Versions of Laravel

**Laravel 10 & Laravel 11 are supported with Statamic 5.** If you need Laravel 9 support, you can still use Statamic 4.x.

## Install Statamic

There are 3 steps to follow to install Statamic into your Laravel app.

1. Run `php artisan config:clear` to make sure your config isn't cached.

2. In `composer.json`, add the following items:

    ``` json
    "scripts": { // [tl! **]
        "pre-update-cmd": [ // [tl! ++ **]
            "Statamic\\Console\\Composer\\Scripts::preUpdateCmd" // [tl! ++ **]
        ],  // [tl! ++ **]
        "post-autoload-dump": [ // [tl! **]
            "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
            "@php artisan package:discover --ansi",
            "@php artisan statamic:install --ansi" // [tl! ++ **]
        ], // [tl! **]
    } // [tl! **]
    ```
   
3. Install `statamic/cms` with Composer.

    ``` shell
    composer require statamic/cms --with-dependencies
    ```

4. Depending on how you set up users in your app, you might need to run a command to publish Statamic's auth migrations.

   ``` shell
   php please auth:migration
   ```

## Adding Content

When you install Statamic into Laravel this way, **no content or views are included**.

You'll probably want to create a collection and some entries, as well as views and a layout in order to see things appear on the front-end of your site.

### Pages
A common "catch-all" content scenario is to create a Pages collection which allows you to create a home page as well as any other pages in a tree structure. You get this when you install Statamic from scratch, but it's easy to set up yourself.

The easiest way is to copy the `pages.yaml` file and the `pages` directory [from the `statamic/statamic` repository](https://github.com/statamic/statamic/tree/5.x/content/collections).

Or, if you wanted to do it through the Control Panel:

1. Create a collection named `pages`.
    - Set the route to `{parent_uri}/{slug}`
    - Enable the "Orderable" toggle
    - Enabled the "Expect a root page" toggle
2. Create an entry. The first one will be your home page.

### Views

Statamic routed URLs will expect views named `default` and `layout`. You will need to add those manually too.

## Database

When you install Statamic into an existing Laravel application, content and users will be stored as flat files.

If you'd prefer to store these in the database, please follow these guides:

* [Storing Content in a Database](/tips/storing-content-in-a-database#overview)
* [Storing Users in a Database](/tips/storing-users-in-a-database#in-an-existing-laravel-app)

## New Statamic Directories

After Statamic is installed, you'll have 3 new directories in your project:
- `content/`,
- `resources/users/`
- `config/statamic/`

:::tip
**Statamic relies on a "catch-all" wildcard route to handle its URLs.** Any explicitly defined routes in your application will take precedence over those handled by Statamic. Be sure that you don't have _your own_ catch-all route or else nothing will ever be passed off to Statamic.
