title: 'Upgrade from 4 to 5'
intro: 'A guide for upgrading from 4 to 5. For most sites (those running Laravel > 9), the process will take less than 5 minutes.'

## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. While there are many items on this page, a majority of them only apply to addons or custom code. We've noted who each item would apply to so you can more easily scan through the changes.

### Upgrade using Composer

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "^4.0" // [tl!--]
"statamic/cms": "^5.0" // [tl!++]
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

### PHP and Laravel support
**Affects apps using PHP < 8.1 or Laravel < 10.**

- The minimum version of PHP is now 8.1.
- The minimum version of Laravel is now 10.

We highly recommend upgrading all the way to Laravel 11 and PHP 8.3.

### Site configuration changes
**Affects everyone.**

_Note that Statamic will attempt to migrate this for you automatically during the upgrade._

The site config has been moved from `config/statamic/sites.php` into `content/sites.yaml`. This allows you to manage your sites from the Control Panel.

```php
// config/statamic/sites.php
return [ // [tl! --:start]
  'sites' => [
    'default' => [
      'name' => 'First Site',
      'url' => config('app.url'),
      'locale' => 'en_US',
    ],
    'two' => [
      'name' => 'Second Site',
      'url' => config('app.site_two_url'),
      'locale' => 'fr_FR',
    ]
  ]
]; // [tl! --:end]
```

```yaml
# content/sites.yaml
default: # [tl! ++:start]
  name: First Site
  url: '{{ config:app:url }}'
  locale: en_US
two:
  name: First Site
  url: '{{ config:app:url }}'
  locale: fr_FR # [tl! ++:end]
```

There is now also a new `multisite` boolean in `config/statamic/system.php`. Previously, the multi-site feature would be considered "enabled" as soon as you configured a second site. Now there is an explicit option to enable it.

This should be set to `true` if you previously had 2 or more sites configured.

```php
// config/statamic/system.php
'multisite' => true,
```

## Medium impact changes

### Site methods
**Affects apps or addons using the `Site::hasMultiple()` method.**

Continuing from the multi-site configuration changes above, there are now two separate methods for determining multi-site state.

- The new `Site::multiEnabled()` method will return true if the `multisite` boolean in `system.php` is enabled.
- The existing `Site::hasMultiple()` method will return `true` if at least two sites are configured.

You should decide whether each existing usage of `Site::hasMultiple()` should imply that the feature is enabled entirely, or if you need to actually count the number of sites.

### Laravel Helpers package has been removed
**Affects apps or addons relying on methods from that package in custom code.**

The `laravel/helpers` package provided support for the older global-style string/array/misc functions like `array_get`, `str_contains`, `snake_case`, `ends_with`, etc. You will now need to either require this package yourself, or update to use the underlying methods.

For example:

```php
namespace App\Example;

use Statamic\Support\Arr; // [tl! ++,**]
use Statamic\Support\Str; // [tl! ++,**]

class Example
{
  function example()
  {
    array_get($arr, $key); // [tl! --,**]
    Arr::get($arr, $key); // [tl! ++,**]
   
    str_start($str, $prefix); // [tl! --,**]
    Str::start($str, $prefix); // [tl! ++,**]
    
    ends_with($str, $needle); // [tl! --,**]
    Str::endsWith($str, $needle); // [tl! ++,**] 
  }
}
```

We recommend making the code changes. However, if you just want to require the package:

```sh
composer require laravel/helpers
```

## Low impact changes

### Validation rule changes
**Affects apps using `unique_entry_value`, `unique_term_value`, or `unique_user_value` rules.**

_Note that assuming you haven't done anything too unusual, the following changes may have been performed automatically by Statamic during the update process._

We have updated our custom validation rules to use the more modern Laravel syntax. This means dropping the string based aliases in favor of classes.

```yaml
validate:
  - 'unique_entry_value:{collection},{id},{site}' #[tl!--]
  - 'new \Statamic\Rules\UniqueEntryValue({collection},{id},{site})' #[tl!++]
    
  - 'unique_term_value:{taxonomy},{id},{site}' #[tl!--]
  - 'new \Statamic\Rules\UniqueTermValue({taxonomy},{id},{site})' #[tl!++]

  - 'unique_user_value:{id}' #[tl!--]
  - 'new \Statamic\Rules\UniqueUserValue({id})' #[tl!++]
```

### Seed removed from `shuffle` modifier
**Affects apps using the shuffle modifier with an argument.**

In Laravel 11, the underlying randomization technique was made more secure and no longer supports seeds. If you need to support seeds, you will need to use a custom modifier.

```
{{ my_array | shuffle:123 }} {{# [tl! --] #}}
{{ my_array | custom_shuffle_with_seed:123 }} {{# [tl! ++] #}}
```

The shuffle modifier without an argument will continue to work without any modification needed.

### Bard JS value is now an object
**Affects apps or addons that are manually targeting Bard's value in JS**

Previously, to prevent issues with how Laravel would trim whitespace on submitted strings, Bard's value would be a JSON stringified version of an object. In Statamic 5, it will just be the object.  

```js
let bardValue = JSON.parse(getBardValue()); // [tl! --]
let bardValue = getBardValue(); // [tl! ++]
```
