# Statamic Sites Api

## Authentication

To access the sites API, you'll need to create a token in your statamic.com account. All of the following endpoints require that your request contains an `Authorization` header with your token preceded by `Bearer`.

### Example Headers

| Header Name | Header Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer 44\|seLDYsDrqyxS2cT8PYremnysuqrovpYHSJ1lzjb3` |
| `Accept` | `application/json` |

### Using Laravel's HTTP Facade

If you are using Laravel's `Http` facade to make your requests, you can use the `acceptJson()` and `withToken()` helper methods to make simple JSON requests with your bearer token:

```php
Http::acceptJson()
  ->withToken($token)
  ->post('https://statamic.com/v1/api/sites, $payload);
```

_*For more info, read more about [headers](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/http-client#headers) and [bearer tokens](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/http-client#bearer-tokens) in Laravel._
