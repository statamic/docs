## Overview

Statamic's CLI commands are built with [Laravel's Artisan Console package][artisan]. To view the list of Statamic-specific commands, you may use the `please list` command:

``` shell
php please list
```

To see _all_ commands available, including those provided by Laravel, use the `artisan list` command.

``` shell
php artisan list
````

## Artisan vs Please

There is no functional difference between Artisan and Please. `please` is merely an alias for `php artisan statamic:`. We just think manners are still important and it feels nice to treat your command line with respect, while saving you a little time typing.

``` shell
# These are equivalent
php please make:user
php artisan statamic:make:user
```

Every command also includes a help screen which displays and describes the command's available arguments and options. To view a help screen, precede the name of the command with help:

``` shell
php please help make:user
```

## Available commands {#commands}

You can see the list of available commands in your terminal by running `php please list`. But for those who don't feel like it, haven't installed yet, or are scared of the command line, here they are also.
