Statamic leverages task scheduling via Laravel's Task Scheduler.

In a nutshell, you can create a single cron job which will allow things to happen on a schedule, without any visitors needing to be on the site.

[Learn more about scheduling tasks in the Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/scheduling)

## Running the scheduler

### In Production

In production, you will need to set up a single once-per-minute cron entry that runs the `schedule:run` Artisan command.

Using a service like Laravel Forge makes this simple.

```sh
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### In Development

Typically, you would not add a scheduler cron entry to your local development machine. Instead, you may use the `schedule:work` Artisan command. This command will run in the foreground and invoke the scheduler every minute until you terminate the command:

```sh
php artisan schedule:work
```

## Included tasks

The following tasks will be executed whenever the task scheduler is running, without you needing to enable anything.

### EntryScheduleReached

Statamic will dispatch a `Statamic\Events\EntryScheduleReached` event whenever a scheduled entry reaches its target date. This event is used in multiple places such as updating search indexes and invalidating caches.

The event will be dispatched on the minute _after_ the scheduled time.


## Defining Schedules

One way to add your own scheduled tasks is by adding items to your `routes/console.php` file.

```php
Schedule::command('my-command')->daily();

Schedule::job(new Heartbeat)->everyFiveMinutes();
```
