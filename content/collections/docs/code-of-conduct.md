This is the Statamic Code of Conduct. By participating here, you are expected to uphold this code like a knight of old. This code of conduct applies to all spaces used by the Statamic community for communication. This includes the Statamic Discord, forums, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, meetups, conferences, and any other relevant forums. If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting us at [statamic.com/support](https://statamic.com/support). Your identity will remain confidential.

- **Treat others in the way you want to be treated.** Respect each other, we’re all on the same team here so let’s have fun, share what we know, and hopefully learn something new! No bullying, harassment, foul language, racism, sexism, or other negative "isms". Generally, just be awesome to each other.

- **There is always another side to every story.** When interpreting the words and actions of others, always assume good intentions. Sometimes it's difficult, but everyone has a bad day now and then. Someday it might be your turn.

- **Don’t be afraid to ask.** There is no such thing as a dumb question. We’re all here to learn and we encourage people to ask questions about anything Statamic-related.

- **Don't bash other platforms** (e.g. WordPress, Craft, ExpressionEngine, etc). They all serve their purposes, markets, and provide livelihoods for thousands of developers. Please be welcoming to those coming from those communities to check out Statamic. Hopefully they'll find something they love, but it won't happen every time. :blush:
