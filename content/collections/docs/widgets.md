The Control Panel's dashboard may contain any number of widgets. A widget is simply a box that shows something. That something might be anything from a list of recently updated entries, to a randomized inspiration quote, and anything in between.

Statamic comes bundled with a handful of widgets, however you may also [create your own](/extending/widgets) or use ones [created by others](https://statamic.com/addons/tags/widget).

## Configuration
Widgets can be added to the dashboard by modifying the widgets array in the `config/statamic/cp.php` file.

Each item in the array should specify the widget as the type, plus any widget-specific configuration values.

You may use the same widget multiple times, configured in different ways.
