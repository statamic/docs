## Finding addons

You can browse the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons) to find addons, or use the "Addons" section inside your Statamic Control Panel.

## Installing addons

You can use Composer to install any addon:

``` shell
composer require vendor/package
```

The command can be found on the addon's page in the Control Panel or the Statamic Marketplace.

:::tip
Some first party addons – such as the Static Site Generator or Eloquent Driver - have their own dedicated commands which will be noted on the same pages.

```shell
php please install:ssg 
```
:::

## Creating addons

To learn how to create your own addon, as well as publishing it to the Statamic Marketplace, head over to the [Extending Statamic](/extending/addons) area.

## Licensing

Addons may require a license, which you can purchase at the [Marketplace](https://statamic.com/marketplace). Licenses may be attached to a site in your [account area](https://statamic.com/account/sites). Make sure that you have your site key entered into your Statamic project.

You can try out commercial addons locally for free. Be sure to purchase a license before deploying to production.

## Editions

An addon may have multiple editions, which may cost different amounts and provide different sets of features.

You can choose which edition is installed by entering it into your `config/statamic/editions.php` file:

``` php
'addons' => [
    'vendor/package' => 'pro', // e.g., 'jezzdk/statamic-google-maps' => 'pro'
]
```

Or, by choosing it from an addon's details view in the Control Panel.
